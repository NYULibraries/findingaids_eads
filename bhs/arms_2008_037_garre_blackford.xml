                <emph render="bold">Ichthyophagus Club</emph> was a dinner club which was established in the City of New York in 1880. The group organized dinners which featured seafood which was not typically prepared for 19th century meals, such as shark, octopus, skate, and other sea animals. Dinners were held at several locations between 1880 and 1887, including the Murray Hill Hotel, J.H. Starin's Glen Island, Havermeyer's Point, the Hotel Brighton, the Manhattan Beach Hotel, the Hotel Buckingham, and the Palisade Mountain House.</p>

According to the preamble of the organization's constitution and by-laws, the group was formed, "for the purpose of guarding and protecting the mariners who enter the port of New York and giving comfort to the desponding wanderers." The group operated mission rooms at the Mariners' Temple, located at Oliver Street and Henry Street, in Manhattan. Members conducted missionary visits to ships, distributed bibles, and offered religious services to sailors and other travelers.</p>

            <p>The collection is primarily composed of papers which belonged to Eugene G. Blackford, specifically regarding two organizations: the Mariners' and Wanderers' Aid Society and the Ichthyophagus Club. The papers were collected by David C. Garre.</p>
            <p>Blackford served as Secretary to the Mariners' and Wanderers' Aid Society. Items related to this organization include reports, meeting minutes, the Society's constitution and by-laws, and clippings, dating from 1866 to 1867.</p>
            <p>Blackford was also a member and Treasurer of the Ichthyophagus Club, a Manhattan-based dining club, and his papers relating to this organization include dinner invitations and menus, dating from 1880 to 1887. The dinners were held at various locations in Manhattan, Coney Island, Long Island, and New Jersey. The Ichthyophagus Club menus feature fantastical illustrations of sea life.</p>
            <p>The collection also contains three items related to David C. Garre's ancestors: a photograph of his aunt, Margaret R. (Gray) Garre, circa 1930s; a photograph of four unidentified persons, circa 1930s; and a thank-you card sent from Mrs. William McKinley (Ida Saxton McKinley) to Margaret R. Gray, 1901.</p>
