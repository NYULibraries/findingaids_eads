    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The Orphan Asylum Society of the City of Brooklyn was established as the first organization of its kind by Mrs. Joshua (Ann) Sands and other prominent Brooklynites in 1833. The society was formed in response to a cholera epidemic in the summer of 1832, which left many children as orphans. The Orphan Asylum Society cared for children who were destitute or orphaned, offering shelter, food, and schooling. Throughout the 19th century, the society housed children until adulthood, or arranged indentures to families outside of Brooklyn. The asylum moved several times due to overpopulation, from its original location at the Jackson Mansion on Willow Street and Love Lane in Brooklyn Heights, to its final location at Brookwood Hall in East Islip, N.Y in 1942. In 1952, a new branch of the society named Brookwood Child Care opened on Adelphi Street in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, offering adoptions, foster care, and social services to families in Brooklyn. The society continued operation under the Brookwood name until its closure in 2003.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The Orphan Asylum Society of the City of Brooklyn records, dated 1834 to 1997 and measuring 3.5 linear feet, contains the reports and registers of the Orphan Asylum Society related to its offices in Brooklyn, Brookwood Hall in East Islip, and Brookwood Child Care in Brooklyn. The bulk of the collection contains annual reports, by-laws, and regulations (which provide financial data, advisory board member names, and personnel information).

Also included are certificates of adoption and indentures from the 19th century, proclamations from the city of New York, and enlarged publicity photographs used for society publications (located in box OS-25).</p>  </scopecontent>
