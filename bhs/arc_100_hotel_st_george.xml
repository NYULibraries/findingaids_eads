    <head>Historical note</head>
<p>The block of buildings in the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn that are collectively known as the Hotel St. George once comprised the largest hotel in New York City. Its constituent buildings were built betwen 1885 and 1929 on the block bounded by Clark, Pineapple, Hicks, and Henry Streets. Its primary building, the St. George Tower, once attracted celebrities, professional athletes, and presidential candidates, and boasted the Colorama Ballroom (at one time known as the largest banquet room in the world), as well as the largest salt water swimming pool in the United States. </p><p>The last remaining portion of the Hotel St. George that operated as a hotel was burnt down in 1995. As of 2010, the St. George Tower operates as a residential cooperative building, while the 100 Henry Street entrance (also known as the Weller Wing) and the 55 Clark Street entrance are now both part of Educational Housing Services (EHS), which offers dormitory services to students of many New York City colleges and universities. The buildings that comprise the Hotel St. George are protected under the New York City Landmarks Preservation Law.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>The Hotel St. George collection spans the dates 1930 to 1990, with the bulk of materials falling within the years 1982 to 1986. Included in the collection are floorplans of the Hotel St. George, circa 1930-1950; a schematic rendering of the hotel building complex, circa 1930-1950; a photocopy of a Hotel St. George promotional brochure, 1932; an advertisement for Vinold Reiss Studios, the designers of the interior of the hotel, 1930; a copy of the hotel manager's stationary, circa 1930-1950; postcards depicting the hotel's exterior, circa 1930s; and several black and white photographic slides that depict banquets held in the hotel's ballrooms in 1932; and a  1939 album of interiors of the hotel, including the Grand Ballroom, the swimming pool, resturants and individual hotel rooms.</p><p>The materials that comprise the bulk date span of the collection consist primarily of copies of the <emph render="italic">St. George News and Views</emph>, a newsletter written and published by the St. George Tower Tenants' Association. These materials mostly document the process of converting the St. George Tower into a cooperative residential building during the 1980s, as well as providing insight into the daily lives of the building's residents. Also included are clippings from various New York City newspapers that document the St. George Tower's co-op conversion process, as well as life in the surrounding neighborhood during this period.</p>  </scopecontent>
