            <p>The collection consists of photographs of the Caltagirone and related families (especially the La Rocca family), dating from circa 1900 to 1999. Photographic formats include black-and-white prints, color prints, tinted photographs, tintypes, and negatives. Thematically, the photographs document a 20th century Italian-American family in Brooklyn, including their residences, celebrations, recreation, and family life. The photographs were collected by Marian Caltagirone.</p>
            <p>The earliest photographs in the collection are portraits of members of the La Rocca and Caltagirone families, dating from the 1900s to the 1930s. These include seven photographs mounted on buttons (or pins), some of which are hand-tinted and/or backed with mirrors.</p>
            <p>The Fort Greene Houses, where the Caltagirones resided, are extensively documented (interiors and exteriors). These photographs date from the 1940s to the 1960s.

            <p>The photographs depict a number of family celebrations and holidays, including Christmas, birthdays, weddings, graduations, first communions, and reunions. The collection includes a number of wedding thank you cards with portraits of the brides and grooms (circa 1930s to 1970s).</p>
            <p>Later photographs document the Augustana Lutheran Home for the Aged (1680 60th Street) and snow-covered streets in the Bath Beach neighborhood of Brooklyn (1995).</p>

            <head>Biographical note</head>
            <p>Marian Caltagirone was born to Agostino and Concetta "Tina" (La Rocca) Caltagirone in 1929. Her father was born in Sicily circa 1900, and immigrated to New York in 1920. Her mother was born in New York circa 1908 to Gerlando and Phillippine La Rocca. Gerlando was also born in Sicily, and his family had immigrated to New York by 1905. Both Gerlando and Agostino were barbers by trade. Marian had one brother, John Caltagirone, who was born in 1939. The La Roccas resided on Marcy Avenue, in both the Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhoods of Brooklyn. Starting in the 1940s, the Caltagirones lived at 107 Navy Walk in the nearby Fort Greene Houses. By the 1960s, members of the family had relocated to 1553 39th Street in the Borough Park neighborhood of Brooklyn. Marian attended Mark Hopkins J.H.S. 148 and the Eastern District High School as a teenager; she later graduated from Brooklyn College in 1977. Agostino passed away in 1985. Concetta lived in the Augustana Lutheran Home for the Aged (1680 60th Street) from 1986 until her death in 1990.</p>
