            <p>Crossing Borders, Bridging Generations (CBBG) was an oral history project and public programming series sponsored by Brooklyn Historical Society from 2011 to 2014. CBBG was designed to examine the history and experiences of mixed-heritage people and families in Brooklyn. The project also explored the broader themes of cultural hybridity, race, ethnicity, and identity formation in the United States. CBBG was created by Sady Sullivan, Director of Oral History at Brooklyn Historical Society from 2006-2014, and the project was funded with assistance from public and private grants. CBBG expanded upon Brooklyn Historical Society’s oral history collection, which was founded in 1973 and contains interviews with over 1200 narrators.</p>

            <head>Oral History note</head>
            <p>Oral history interviews are intimate conversations between two people, both of whom have agreed to share the recordings with Brooklyn Historical Society and with researchers. Please listen in the spirit with which these were shared. Researchers will understand that:</p>
            <p>1. Brooklyn Historical Society abides by the General Principles &amp; Best Practices for Oral History as agreed upon by the Oral History Association (2009) and expects that use of this material will be done with respect for these professional ethics.</p>
            <p>2.This transcript is a nearly verbatim copy of the recorded interview. As such, it may contain the natural false starts, verbal stumbles, misspeaks, and repetitions that are common in conversation. This decision was made because Brooklyn Historical Society gives primacy to the audible voice and also because some researchers do find useful information in these verbal patterns.</p>
            <p>3.Unless these verbal patterns are germane to your scholarly work, when quoting from this material researchers are encouraged to correct the grammar and make other modifications maintaining the flavor of the narrator’s speech while editing the material for the standards of print.</p>
        </odd>
        <processinfo id="ref171">
            <head>Processing Information note</head>
            <p>All narrators were provided with transcripts of their oral histories and given the opportunity to make redactions and additions. Library staff incorporated the narrators' edits into transcripts and audio recordings. As a result, some of the audio recordings may contain segments that sound uneven or choppy. Additionally, due to privacy concerns, the birthdates of all narrators were redacted from the transcripts and audio recordings featured on the CBBG website.</p>
            <p>The CBBG interviewers and narrators discussed the history and experiences of mixed-heritage people and families in an open and forthright manner. This finding aid was therefore created with forthright and descriptive language, i.e., when available, the narrator’s race, heritage, nationality, and religion were recorded in the biographical and scope notes.</p>
