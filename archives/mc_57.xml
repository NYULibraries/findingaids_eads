            <p>Robert Ogden Doremus was a chemist who spent his life researching, teaching, and inventing. Born in 1824 in New York City, Doremus attended Columbia University in 1838 for one year and then transferred to the University of the City of New York (as NYU was then known) and graduated in 1842 with a B.A. degree. During his time at the University he studied under John Draper and developed a great knowledge and love for chemistry and physics. In 1851 he became a professor at the College of the City of New York and eventually became the head of the Physics and Chemistry Department and Vice President of that institution. In addition to teaching, Doremus played a role in the founding of the New York Medical College, the Long Island Hospital and Medical College and the Bellevue Hospital Medical College. Doremus passed away in 1906 at the age of 83.</p>
