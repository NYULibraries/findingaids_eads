            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>A native of Hubbard, Ohio, George Rowland Collins was born on August 27, 1894. He graduated from Macalaster College in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1916 and earned the Master of Arts degree from Harvard University four years later. In 1922 he was awarded an MBA from New York University.</p>
            <p>Collins began his teaching and administrative career at NYU in 1920. That year, he joined the faculty as an Instructor in public speaking in the English Department at University College. By 1923 he was Assistant Professor of Marketing and Public Speaking, rising to Associate Professor the following year, and to Professor of Marketing in 1926. One year later, Professor Collins was appointed Assistant Dean of the School of Commerce, Accounts, and Finance. He became Associate Dean in 1931. Upon the retirement of A. Wellington Taylor in 1943, Collins was appointed Acting Dean of the Graduate School of Business Administration, as well as Acting Director of the Wall Street Division of the School of Commerce. The following year he was appointed to the deanship of GBA and the directorship of the Wall Street Division.</p>
            <p>Dean Collins' dual administrative responsibilities in GBA and Commerce increased in 1948 when, upon the retirement of Dean John T. Madden, Chancellor Harry W. Chase selected Collins Acting Dean of the School of Commerce. In October 1948 he was appointed Dean and served in that capacity until 1955, when he relinquished the office in order to devote his energy to conducting a major fundraising campaign to gain new quarters for GBA. He was replaced at the School of Commerce by Thomas L. Norton. Collins continued as Dean of GBA until his retirement in June 1959. He died on October 10, 1968.</p>
