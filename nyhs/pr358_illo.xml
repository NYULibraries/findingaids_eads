            <head>Scope and Contents</head>
            <p>John Illo's photographs exhibit three themes:</p>
            <p>
                <emph render="boldunderline">Ships and waterfront</emph>: Vessels, especially tugboats, in and around New York Harbor, some with visible names, others unidentified (see the container list for specifics), and general views of Manhattan docks and infrastructure. Only two prints are dated (1949 and 1950). Includes 12 snapshots of the wrecked 
                <emph render="italic">Morro Castle</emph>, an ill-fated ocean liner which burned en route from Havana to New York on 8 September 1934, killing 137 passengers and crew members. The 
                <emph render="italic">Morro Castle</emph> remained beached near Asbury Park, New Jersey, for several months until it was towed away and scrapped. (Illo was 8 years old at the time and did not take these photographs.)
                <lb/></p>
            <p>
                <emph render="boldunderline">New York City scenes</emph>: Views of some major Manhattan landmarks (see container list for details), with a number of general street scenes. Only one photograph in this set, of the shelves in an antique shop, is dated: 1947.
                <lb/></p>
            <p>
                <emph render="boldunderline">People</emph>: Random "characters" Illo encountered on the streets of Manhattan (see the container list for descriptions). None of the prints are dated.</p>
