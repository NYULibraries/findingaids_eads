            <head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>
            <p>Felix George Rohatyn was born on 29 May 1928 in Vienna, Austria. His family moved to France in 1935 where his parents divorced and his mother remarried. Rohatyn and his mother (Edith Plessner) and his step-father (Henry Plessner), all Jews, narrowly escaped Nazi-occupied France in 1940. With the intervention of Luiz Martins de Souza Dantas, the Brazilian ambassador to France, the family eventually moved to Brazil. In June 1942, the family arrived in New York City. Beginning in 1944, Rohatyn attended Middlebury College in Vermont. He returned to France briefly in 1947 to reunite with his father at his brewing business, but then returned to America to graduate in 1949 from Middlebury with a degree in physics. Rohatyn’s stepfather’s acquaintance with André Meyer, the head of the investment banking firm Lazard Frères, led to Felix joining the firm in 1949, setting the course of his professional life in finance.</p>
            <p>Rohatyn became a U.S. citizen in May 1950. His initial assignments for Lazard had him working for affiliated firms in Europe, but these were interrupted when Rohatyn was drafted into the U.S. Army from 1951 to 1953. He went through basic training at Camp Atterbury, Indiana, and the Army Intelligence School at Fort Riley, Kansas. Assigned to the 28th Infantry Division, Rohatyn was sent to Germany at the rank of sergeant and with the title of Order of Battle Specialist. At the conclusion of his military service, he returned to Lazard, working first in Europe and then joining the New York office in 1955, where he would remain until 1997. In 1956, Rohatyn married Jeannette Streit, an interpreter who worked on the United Nations staff. They would have three sons together: Pierre, Nicolas and Michael.</p>
            <p>By the early 1960s, Rohatyn was a partner at Lazard, working as an investment banker with mergers and acquisitions. The nature of this work led him beyond Lazard, taking positions on the Boards of firms he advised, such as ITT, and positions supporting the financial industry more generally, such as being on the New York Stock Exchange’s Board of Governors (1968-72). This expanding network eventually led, in 1975, to Rohatyn being asked by New York Governor Hugh Carey to bring his expertise to bear on the fiscal crisis faced by New York City. As part of the rescue initiative, a new entity, the Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC) was formed, and Rohatyn was named its Chairman within a few months of its creation. Rohatyn helped lead the effort to manage New York’s brush with bankruptcy through 1975 and then through the following years as the city’s finances stabilized and strengthened. Rohatyn stayed on with MAC until 1993 when he stepped down as Chairman.</p>
            <p>In 1979, Rohatyn married his second wife, Elizabeth (née Fly). Elizabeth was born in 1930 in Memphis. She had been previously married twice and had a daughter, Nina, from her first marriage. Through the 1980s, the Rohatyns expanded their philanthropic activities, including support for the I Have a Dream Foundation (the 1986 cohort of students in the program is known as the "Rohatyn cohort") and with Elizabeth joining the Board of Trustees of the New York Public Library in 1985. In 1994, Elizabeth founded Teaching Matters Inc. (TMI), a not-for-profit organization aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of teachers and school administrators, especially with respect to the integration of technology into schools.</p>
            <p>In April 1997, Felix resigned from Lazard and a few months later was named by President Bill Clinton to the position of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to France. He and Elizabeth moved to Paris where they served until December 2000. Near the conclusion of Rohatyn’s tenure as ambassador, Elizabeth founded a new organization, the French Regional &amp; American Museum Exchange (FRAME). The mission of the organization was, and is, to develop U.S.-France cultural exchanges in the context of museum collaborations for exhibitions, education programs, and the like. Elizabeth served as Co-Founding Co-President of FRAME, along with Francoise Cachin, who was then the Director of the Musées de France.</p>
            <p>Returning to America in 2001, Felix formed an advisory firm, Rohatyn Associates LLC, and also served on the Boards of various business interests and policy groups, such as the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies (CSIS). During the early 2000s, he more fully developed as an advocate for government investment in America’s infrastructure, a theme he elaborated in his book 
                <emph render="italic">Bold Endeavors: How Our Government Built America, and Why It Must Rebuild Now</emph> (2009). He also wrote a memoir, 
                <emph render="italic">Dealings: A Political and Financial Life</emph> (2010), of his career in finance, reflecting on his early career, his work in mergers and acquisitions for Lazard, and New York City’s crisis year of 1975. He returned to Lazard in 2010 as an adviser to Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth M. Jacobs.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth had been named Chairman of the New York Public Library in November 1995, and returned to America in 2001 to continue her active involvement on the Board as Chairman Emeritus. She also continued her active engagement with Teaching Matters, FRAME, and other organizations. Elizabeth died in 2016.</p>

            <p>The Elizabeth and Felix G. Rohatyn papers include documents related to the Rohatyns’s public service, philanthropy, and policy advocacy on matters of political economy and international relations, especially for the 1990s and early 2000s. The collection includes an extensive set of Felix’s correspondence files from the 2000s that principally concern his advocacy for government investment in national infrastructure projects, along with political and business matters. These files hold correspondence from many notable individuals, including U.S. presidents (especially Bill Clinton), many U.S. senators and congressmen and congresswomen, business leaders, and others. Rohatyn’s policy advocacy is documented in his speeches, articles and other writings, and interviews found throughout the collection. There is a set of papers from Rohatyn’s years as ambassador to France (1997-2000), including confirmation documents, schedules, and binders of the speeches he made during these years. Rohatyn’s activities with respect to New York City’s fiscal crisis in 1975 are lightly represented with clippings and a series of photographic negatives taken in connection with activities of the Municipal Assistance Corporation and legislation signed by President Jimmy Carter in August 1978.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth Rohatyn’s initiatives in the educational and cultural arenas are well-represented in the collection. Elizabeth’s founding of and continuing engagement with the French Regional &amp; American Museum Exchange (FRAME) and with Teaching Matters, Inc. (TMI) are included, as are some files concerning her involvement with the Board of Trustees of the New York Public Library. Elizabeth’s involvement in social diplomacy as the wife of the ambassador to France is reflected in the collection.</p>
            <p>The collection also holds many photographs of Felix, Elizabeth and their families. Felix’s years as a child, as a young man, in the military, in leisure activities like skiing, with Bill Clinton, at award ceremonies, and others are in the collection. One photograph of Felix was taken and autographed by Richard Avedon. Elizabeth is represented in photographs primarily from later years with Felix and at gala events, likely associated with the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>

                    <p>The series is arranged in alphabetical order, which is principally by correspondent but also includes subject matter references. This follows the original order of a set of files, into which loose and unlabeled documents were added by the processing archivist. Most loose documents were added into the original "miscellaneous" folders, which already held most of the correspondence. Folder labels created by the archivist for certain correspondents and subjects that were not in the original set are not differentiated in the container list below, but are shown in [brackets] on the actual boxed folders. Miscellaneous news articles and other reference material are at the end of the files.</p>
                </arrangement>
                <scopecontent id="ref14">
                    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
                    <p>The series includes files of Felix Rohatyn’s correspondence, primarily from 2001 to about 2010, that is, the years after his ambassadorship to France. A significant theme running through much, perhaps most, of the correspondence is Rohatyn’s advocacy for government investment in national infrastructure projects. This theme emerges in various contexts, notably in files concerning the transition team for New York Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer (2006), for a meeting of state investment officials convened by Rohatyn, California State Treasurer Philip Angelides and New York Comptroller H. Carl McCall regarding potential use of pension plans for infrastructure development (2002), long-term planning for New York under Mayor Michael Bloomberg (2002), rebuilding in New York after the attacks of 9/11 on the World Trade Center (2001), and the National Governors Association consideration of federal spending on building (2009). The files include remarks and articles by Rohatyn on the subject, with contextual documents such as clippings, government reports, and other material. (Standalone files of Rohatyn’s writings and remarks are found in other series.) The World Trade Center attacks themselves also emerge as a subject, as correspondents from both the U.S. and overseas write to Rohatyn expressing sympathy for the tragic events of 9/11.</p>
                    <p>Rohatyn’s advisory business interests are another theme of the series, though these appear in less depth. The series holds some early financial statements and required firm policy documents for Rohatyn’s advisory firm, Rohatyn Associates LLC; a company overview of Lazard (2009); and a few Board meeting packets for companies at which Rohatyn served as a Board member. The economic relationship between the U.S. and Europe, Rohatyn’s philanthropy, his support for certain politicians and public policy objectives, opposition to the death penalty, and awards and other recognitions bestowed on Rohatyn are among the other topics of the correspondence.</p>
                    <p>The correspondents found in the series are principally from the worlds of finance/business and politics. There are several letters from President Bill Clinton, with Presidents Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush also appearing. Letters from Supreme Court Justices, Cabinet officials, senators, and congressmen and congresswomen are also found in the series, as are letters from New York City mayors, corporate executives, and international statesmen and businesspeople. Nonetheless, many of these letters are not especially substantive, often simply expressing thanks or other courtesy on a matter. Overall, the container list identifies at the folder level any notable individuals, particularly from the political arena, and subjects. Many of the letters to and from overseas correspondents are in French.</p>
                    <p>The series also includes several folders of general press clippings and tear sheets concerning business, economics, and other such matters, several of which refer to Rohatyn.</p>

                    <p>The series includes a few documents concerning New York’s fiscal crisis of the mid-late 1970s. These include 21 rolls of 35mm photographic negatives relating to the Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC) taken in August 1978 by Carl Roodman. The most recognizable subject matter is the 8 August 1978 visit to City Hall by President Jimmy Carter where he signed legislation giving a $1.65 billion Federal loan guarantee to the city. There are photographs of the crowds, speakers at the podium, Carter's arrival and bill signing, and other such shots of the event. The specific subject matter of the other photographs is somewhat uncertain as to what is being depicted. But these appear to be photographs of the MAC staff at work in their offices in 2 World Trade Center; meetings and working sessions among various principals; discussions between MAC Executive Director Eugene Keilin, Rohatyn, and others; and possibly of the MAC Special Board Meeting of 11 August 1978, which took place at the midtown law office of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the photographs, there are photocopies of press clippings, the issue of 
                        <emph render="italic">Newsweek</emph> featuring Rohatyn on its cover, a transcript of a US Senate hearing at which Rohatyn spoke, and articles, mostly from the 2000s, that included reflections on the events of the mid-1970s.</p>

                    <p>The series includes the texts of various prepared speeches, testimony or other public remarks Rohatyn delivered, primarily from 2001 to 2009, with a few from earlier and later years. (Speeches made during his years as ambassador to France are found in Series IV.) The subjects of these remarks centered on the role of government in spending on infrastructure, economic relationships between the U.S. and Europe, capitalism, recollections of New York City’s fiscal crisis, and other matters concerning political economy. Audiences included houses of the U.S. Congress, the 92nd Street Y, New York Public Library, the Institute of French Studies at New York University, City University of New York (CUNY), the U.S. Conference of Mayors, AFSCME, the Chicago Humanities Festival, the World Affairs Council, the Academie des Sciences Morales et Politiques, COFACE, the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, the Center for American Progress, the Economic Club of Chicago, the American Library in Paris, the National Governors Association, and others. Some of these texts are in French.</p>
                    <p>The series also includes Rohatyn’s writings on mostly economic policy subjects. These take the form of clippings, photocopies and tear sheets from newspapers and other periodicals in which opinion pieces authored or co-authored by Rohatyn appeared. These also date primarily from 2000 to 2008. (Articles and clippings that refer to Rohatyn or quote him in passing are generally not found in this series, but are in the general reference files of Series I. Articles concerning New York’s fiscal crisis are in Series II.)</p>
                    <p>The series includes extensive, various drafts of Rohatyn’s memoirs, which were published under the title 
                        <emph render="italic">Dealings</emph>, but were also known by a working title of 
                        <emph render="italic">Money Games</emph>. These range from early drafts of chapters written in 2002 to the final versions published in 2010. There are also some drafts of Rohatyn’s book on the history of major capital investments by the U.S. government, 
                        <emph render="italic">Bold Endeavors</emph> (working title: 
                        <emph render="italic">Investing in America</emph>), and portions of the French version of the book.</p>
                    <p>The series also includes published interviews of Rohatyn and profile articles centering on particular aspects of Rohatyn’s career and perspective. There are copies of a videotape of a televised 2000 interview of Rohatyn by Charlie Rose. (The tape is restricted from use because the library lacks playback equipment, but the interview can be viewed, with a transcript, at the Charlie Rose show website:

                    <p>The series includes files related to Felix Rohatyn’s tenure as U.S. Ambassador to France (1997-2000). These include speeches, remarks, interviews, and written articles by Rohatyn, which generally concerned economic matters, relations between the U.S. and France, and Europe generally, and globalization. Also included are many of Rohatyn’s daily schedules; his letter of instruction from President Bill Clinton; documentation concerning the American Presence Posts (APP) initiative, which established small Foreign Service posts in five key cities around France in support of American businesses and citizens; color slides of the paintings in the ambassador's residence; documents related to Rohatyn's confirmation and presentation of credentials; and his resignation and farewell. The series also includes Elizabeth Rohatyn’s schedules and lunch and dinner events, providing insight into the role played by the ambassador’s spouse in the social protocols of diplomacy. Many of the documents are in French.</p>

(TMI), and the New York Public Library (NYPL). The material concerning FRAME is perhaps the richest as it includes documentation related to the founding, first decade, activities, and evolution of this international cultural organization’s operations from 1999 forward. The TMI files also include concept papers, Board minutes, program proposals, and other materials concerning the organization’s mission and development, but coverage is inconsistent, dating mostly from the 2000s, well after the organization’s founding in 1994. Similarly, the New York Public Library files include useful Board and Committee level documents spanning 2002 to 2013, but there is a high level of inconsistency in coverage from year to year.</p>

                        <p>The French Regional &amp; American Museum Exchange (FRAME), now known by the somewhat abbreviated name of French American Museum Exchange, was founded in 1999 by Elizabeth Rohatyn during her husband’s, Felix Rohatyn’s, tenure as U.S. ambassador to France. The mission of the organization was, and is, to develop U.S.-France cultural exchanges in the context of museum collaborations for exhibitions, education programs, and the like. Elizabeth served as one of FRAME’s two Founding Co-Presidents, the other being Francoise Cachin, who was then the Director of the Musées de France. FRAME’s Founding Director was art historian Dr. Richard Brettell of the University of Texas.</p>
                        <p>FRAME initially operated under the auspices of the Foundation for French Museums. In 2006, FRAME incorporated itself as a not-for-profit organization in the United States. FRAME operates through two organizational arms, one in the U.S. and the other in France, each headed by a President and a Director. A Board of Trustees heads the overall organization. Starting from a membership of about 18 museums in 1999, the organization included 30 museums in its consortium as of 2017.</p>
                        <p>FRAME has sponsored about 21 exhibitions since its founding. The first exhibition was 
                            <emph render="italic">Made in the USA: American Art from 1908-1947</emph>, which toured at three museums in France. Most of the exhibitions since then made stops at museums in both the U.S. and France.</p>
                        <p>(The above note was based principally on FRAME's website

                        <p>The TMI files include concept papers, Board meeting minutes and materials, early by-laws, mission statements and strategic plans, fundraising efforts, and budgets. There are also program proposals and reports, including an evaluation of TMI’s One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) pilot program (2008), the McKinsey &amp; Company’s Connecting K-12 Schools to the Information Superhighway (1995), and TMI’s first annual report (1995). There are a few files from TMI’s earliest years in the mid-1990s, but most of the material dates from the 2000s. Coverage is inconsistent; for example, there are materials for only a few Board meetings in the 2000s. The subseries includes a folder of speeches given by Elizabeth from 1993-2000, not necessarily all concerning TMI. That same folder includes contact sheets of photographs of Elizabeth Rohatyn at an unidentified award ceremony and reception.</p>

                        <p>Originally known as The Waterford Institute, the organization was restructured in August 1994 and renamed Teaching Matters, Inc. (TMI).

A not-for-profit organization, TMI focused on the professional development of teachers and school administrators to enhance their effectiveness. In the early years of the organization this mission was expressed particularly in terms of assisting with the integration of technology into the school and classroom</p>

Felix's early life is well-represented, including photographs of him as a child and young man in Europe, serving in the U.S. Army, skiing and doing other leisure activities, and with what appear to be business associates and his young family in the 1950s and 1960s. There are only a few early photographs of Elizabeth. There are many of Elizabeth and Felix from the years after their marriage in 1979, in casual settings such as vacations, at gala events, and at award ceremonies. In addition to photographs, there are a small number of other documents related to, especially, Felix, such as a copy of his birth certificate and employment application to Lazard.</p>
