            <head>Biographical/Historical Note</head>
            <p>Beginning in December 2016 and continuing through February 2017, the third grade at Brooklyn Friends School created a mural of sticky notes (i.e., Post-its). They were inspired in part by 
                <emph render="italic">Subway Therapy</emph>, which was created by artist Matthew “Levee” Chavez following the 2016 presidential election, in which Donald J. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. From the day after the election in November until 16 December, Chavez invited passersby at Manhattan’s Union Square subway station to express their emotions about the election on sticky notes and post them to the station wall. By the time Chavez’s work was taken down, approximately 20,000 total notes had been posted. The Friends School students were further inspired by the book 
                <emph render="italic">Maybe Something Beautiful: How Art Transformed a Neighborhood</emph> by F. Isabel Campoy and Theresa Howell and illustrated by Rafael Lopez, which they had studied in their Caldecott Medal Unit. Similar to Chavez’s subway work, the Brooklyn Friends School third graders’ mural was a response to the election. The mural was created on the third floor Lower School Library by the students under the guidance of the librarians.</p>
            <p>(The above is based largely on a description of the project, which is included in the box with the collection, provided by Brooklyn Friends School.)</p>

            <head>Arrangement Note</head>
            <p>There is no particular arrangement to the sticky notes, that is, how they are found in the container does not necessarily reflect their original relationship to one another on the wall at Brooklyn Friends School.</p>

            <p>The artist Matthew “Levee” Chavez donated a portion of his work 
                <emph render="italic">Subway Therapy</emph>, which was an inspiring concept for the Brooklyn Friends School project, to New-York Historical. See call number MS 3025.</p>
            <p>Also in connection with 
                <emph render="italic">Subway Therapy</emph>, New-York Historical implemented a similar project on its front glass wall, titled
