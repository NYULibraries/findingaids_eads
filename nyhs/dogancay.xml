            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Burhan Dogançay was born in Istanbul in 1929. During the early 1950s, he studied economics and law at the University of Paris and art at La Grande Chaumiere. In 1964 Dogançay moved to New York City, making it his permanent home. Noted primarily as an important painter with a significant interest in urban walls, Burhan Dogançay's career spanned nearly five decades. The Dogançay Museum opened in 2004 in Istanbul where it exhibits Burhan's work as well as the work by his father, Adil Dogançay. After the opening of the museum, Dogançay split his time between New York City, Istanbul, and the south of Turkey where he maintained a studio. Burhan Dogançay died on 16 January 2013 in Istanbul.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The collection contains photographs, negatives, contact prints, slides, sketchbooks, and various books and other print matter concerning Burhan Dogançay's photography and artwork. The bulk of the collection is photographic and is from 1983-1988. Dogançay photographed iron workers restoring the Brooklyn Bridge with the New York City skyline (including the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center) as a backdrop. He also photographed the iron workers building structures for buildings in Midtown. The Lipstick Building is heavily covered in this collection showing its progress from demolition of previous buildings in its place all the way to the finished building. Other notable buildings, including the Citicorp Building and the Chrysler Building, make appearances in the backgrounds of images of the iron workers hard at work. Dogançay took similar photographs in France of the demolition and foundations of buildings which are included in this collection as well, but the vast majority is of New York City.</p>
            <p>Burhan Dogançay sketched in his "Scratchity" sketchbooks graffiti that he came across on New York City walls, subways, and subway stations. This became inspiration for future paintings that he did, some of which can be found in the various books and other materials that are included in this collection. His photographs of iron workers are also depicted in some of the print matter, including a newspaper clipping and a museum brochure.</p>

            <p>Holly Hinman and Kelly McAnnaney initially processed the collection in circa 2005; at that time the collection included only what is now Series I, the 
                <emph render="italic">Bridge of Dreams</emph> photographs. Much more material was donated to N-YHS in 2014-2016. This additional material, which now comprises Series II-IV of the collection, was processed in 2018 by Jessica Flon, who also integrated the earlier material into the whole.</p>

                    <p>Series II makes up the bulk of this collection. It consists of black &amp; white and color negatives, contact prints, black &amp; white and color photographs, and color slides.</p>
                    <p>There are images of steel workers restoring the Brooklyn Bridge and of the New York City skyline taken from a high vantage point on the bridge as the photographer was known to climb as the workers did.</p>
                    <p>There are numerous images that display the iron workers climbing the iron skeletons of buildings, often without wearing a harness. Iron workers are also shown in their downtime on a break or eating lunch.</p>
                    <p>The Lipstick Building (885 Third Avenue in Manhattan) is a highlight of this series. There are images of the demolition of previous structures, the rebuilding of the foundation, the various stages of construction (especially of the iron skeleton) from within the structure as well as from many different viewpoints from surrounding streets and buildings. Images of the completed Lipstick Building are also included. The Citicorp Building is also a highlight of this series; because of its proximity to the Lipstick Building it is found in a great deal of images.</p>
                    <p>Construction images that did not include these two buildings were also taken in the general Midtown Manhattan area, except for some images toward the end of the series that were taken in France. Also at the end of the series there are larger photographs of similar subject matter found throughout this series.</p>
                    <p>Many of the binders that the work was originally organized in were labeled 'Iron Workers' on the outside while inside of the binders many of the sleeves of negatives had 'steel workers' written on them. It is uncertain if the terms 'iron workers' and 'steel workers' were purposely being distinguished or if they were used interchangeably. When not specifically documented as 'iron workers' or 'steel workers', they are referred to as workers in the following Scope and Contents Notes. In some cases these workers are general construction workers, but it is likely that many of the unlabeled workers are iron workers or steel workers.</p>

In the middle of the gallery space there is a color drawing depicting three iron workers at work on the beginnings of a skeleton of a building. Based on the placement of this drawing in the middle of the room it is presumed that this is a sculptural piece that the exhibition is centered around.</p>

                    <p>The "Scratchity" Sketchbooks (aka scratchiti) have sketches of grafitti, "vandalism," and posters that Dogançay came across on subway station walls, subway train windows and walls, as well as other walls of New York City. There is one exception with the 2009 sketchbook which contains sketches from various countries. For the most part the sketches are of phrases, words, or combinations of letters. These combinations of letters likely mean something to someone. There are some sketches of designs/figures, color sketches of the tiled subway walls, and magazine clippings, mostly of people, included in the sketchbooks.</p>
