            <p>N-YHS restricts Executive Office files for 35 years following the departure of a President and Chief Executive Officer. The Executive Office record group begins with the James B. Bell leadership years (1982-1988), so the series that includes those records are restricted until 2024. Other series holding the records of Bell's successors will be opened in subsequent years. While the restriction applies, these records may be used only by, or with the permission of, the President and Chief Executive Officer or her designee.</p>

            <p>This finding aid relates to just one record group of the New-York Historical Society archives. For information about the other record groups and for overall information about the archives, please see the Guide to the 
                <extref ns2:actuate="onRequest" ns2:href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/nyhsrgarchives/">New-York Historical Society Archives</extref> (NYHSRG Archives). Other record groups that are processed and available to researchers and are especially related to the New-York Historical Society Executive Office records (NYHS-RG 22) are as follows:</p>
            <p>For the records of the N-YHS executive (referred to as "Director" from the late 1930s until 1989, and as "Librarian" prior to the late 1930s) prior to James B. Bell's administration (1982-1988), see 
                <extref ns2:actuate="onRequest" ns2:href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/nyhsrg2/">New-York Historical Society General Correspondence</extref> (NYHS-RG 2).</p>
            <p>There is a close correlation between the Executive Office records and the Board of Trustee record group. The Board records are accessible on the same basis as the Executive Office records, meaning Board records are open through 1982. See New-York Historical Society Board of Trustees Records (NYHS-RG 18).</p>
