    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The Subject File spans the period from ca. 1600 to ca. 1976 and primarily contains images of American history and life. The collection is divided into three series by size: Boxed Files holds material smaller than 9 by 14 inches, Flat Files holds items between 9 by 14 and 24 by 40 inches, and Oversize Files holds material larger than 24 by 40 inches. All series include an immense range of printed material and photographs; snapshots, cyanotypes, news release photos, etchings, engravings, photogravures, lithographs and chromolithographs, albumen prints, silver gelatin prints, cabinet cards, book plates, and second generation copy photography are represented throughout the Subject File.</p><p>The hierarchy is the same throughout the collection, although all categories do not appear in each series. Cross-references are made within the container list when appropriate. Where possible, Library of Congress subject headings and organizational terms have been used. This file is meant to be an open and active file, and will most likely see many new additions. The following description is current only as of December 2002.</p><p>The amount and disparate types of material in this collection preclude an itemized discussion of each subject covered. Below are descriptions of some of the collection's highlights. Most of the notable material in this collection can be found in the PEOPLE subseries, in both Series I and II. Subseries level categories (the "subjects" covered in the collection) are rendered in all capital letters in the text. Further divisions of those categories or folder titles are found in quotes. Due to the complicated structure of the collection, only the subseries level categories are listed here. Researchers are encouraged to consult the box and folder list, which is held at the Department of Prints, Photographs, and Architectural Collections, as well as the text below, for more detailed information about the Subject File.</p>  </scopecontent>

The cabinet cards were taken by Mrs. G. M. Bowen, a photographer from Waterloo, Iowa, of individual participants at a "merchants' carnival." In these photographs women physically advertise local shops and products by wearing dress skirts decorated with the products. For example, a woman with shoe soles pinned to the bottom of her dress is holding a banner advertising UTK Fine Footwear. One of the women advertise Bowen's photograph gallery. The cards were originally from the George T. Bagoe Collection, donated by Mrs. Elihu Spicer in 1960-61. The related scanned image in the folder was donated in July 2018 by Joseph B. Young; the image is a group shot showing all the participants.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref14_j28" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>AGRICULTURE</unittitle><container id="aspace_676d7db760a9cc41e14cfd1a5fb01710" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container></did><odd id="aspace_ae92c60f2274a91e58ebfb929f834644"><head>General Note</head><p>See also: Series II</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_ref16_ak4" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>ALLEGORICAL PRINTS</unittitle><container id="aspace_21102b8c1e1cc63db8fd6a44acf970f4" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container></did><odd id="aspace_d8e19b6b142719015166bebfce915027"><head>General Note</head><p>See also: Series II and Series III</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_ref18_tcu" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>ANIMALS</unittitle><container id="aspace_f15f0b7498e953c7da1d09f91165803a" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container></did><odd id="aspace_0b7ad8b1b9ab29afef5472966e65a883"><head>General note</head><p>See also: Series II</p></odd><scopecontent id="aspace_5768244fed9a202bc12c0bb48864c9dd"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>mostly comprised of photographs of horses.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref20_fba" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>ART</unittitle><container id="aspace_5b79f03ddf600022bf764651542a3b7b" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_332858030df9827d210616d765274653"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>is divided into "Painting" and "Sculpture."

Also represented are Civil War-era and later caricatures of African Americans, including many which were               photographed and made into cabinet cards.  The many images of slavery include an albumen print showing              the interior of a slave pen in Alexandria, Virginia, and a French engraving of a slave sale in America. A                   number of prints cut from newspapers in 1858-9 detail the story of 200 captured slaves who were taken to              Liberia on the steam-frigate Niagara.

Photographs with the same provenance or which are historically notable have                      been isolated into their own folders. One of these is a series of photographs taken by the U.S. Signal                      Corps ca. 1890 in the Black Hills of Montana around the time of Custer's battle. A set of cabinet cards                     issued by the Santa Fe Route train company shows Native Americans of the Southwest, and were probably               meant as a tourist advertisement. One folder includes portrait photographs taken by William Henry                         Jackson for the Bureau of American Ethnology. Cyanotypes are also housed together.</p><p> Early European prints include a 1756 engraving of "Hendrick the Sachem, or Chief, of the Mohawks" and                  an 1827 hand-colored lithograph of "Les six Indiens de la tribu des Osages." A portrait of "Philip, King of                 Mount Hope," (Philip, Sachem of the Wampanoags, of King Philip's War) was engraved by Paul Revere,                    and is a plate from the 1772 edition of Benjamin Church's The Entertaining History of King Philip's War.                  Portraits of a "Maha Queen" and an "Ottoes Chief" are pages from an 1809 edition of the  Travels of                       Capts. Lewis and Clark. Additional early portraits are of "Joseph Thayendanekan, a Mohawk Chief," and                  of "Mico Chlucco the Long Warrior, Chief of the Seminoles." Any portrait in which a tribe was named has                 been filed with other images of Native Americans in that tribe. Portraits in which no tribe was mentioned               are filed alphabetically. </p><p> Prints after the work of early painters of Native Americans are plentiful. Most are hand-colored                               lithographs. A collection of plates of portraits of Indians after the artist George Catlin was given by Mrs.                 Ernest C. Kinney, a granddaughter-in-law of Catlin. These are most probably from a circa 1860 American                 edition of Catlin's Letters and Notes on the Manners, Customs, and Condition of the North American                       Indians, and are housed together with a few other prints after Catlin. Scenes engraved after Carl Bodmer,               mainly for publication in mid to late 19th century magazines are found throughout this category.</p><p> Several lithographs are by John T. Bowen. Many of these images were published in Thomas McKenney and               James Hall's History of the Indian Tribes of North America 1836-1844. One folder contains hand-colored                  lithographs after James Otto Lewis's paintings of Native Americans. Some of these were lithographed by                 J. H. Bufford. Another folder contains hand-colored engravings after drawings by Jacques Grasset de                      Saint-Sauveur (1757-1810). Eight are from Grasset's  Encyclopedie des Voyages. . ., Paris: 1796. These                   drawings are all of Iroquois and were engraved by Jean Laroque (active 1730-1775). Other plates from                    another of Saint-Sauveur's books, all with French captions, are also included. These are possibly from a                   later edition of his  Costumes Civils Actuels de Tous les Peuples Connus, first published in 1788. </p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref213_vim" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>PEOPLE - HOMELESS PERSONS</unittitle><container id="aspace_53c1b2c5d6d97f9ca3f45af7024c9071" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">10</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref276_poy" level="subseries"><did><unittitle>PEOPLE - LABORERS</unittitle><container id="aspace_70091879228566070df8c496d9eabf8f" label="Graphic Materials" type="Box">10</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_265afd525a1865184034cef04f6c3c64"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>Includes two etchings matted together.

Many of these are lithographed copies of a calligraphic exercise, in which the text has been altered in scale and pen stroke thickness so as to create images such as portraits within the text. For example, the text of the Emancipation Proclamation has been highlighted in certain ways so that Abraham Lincoln's face is clearly visible in the text. These prints (which include the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States) were all drawn by R. Morris Swander, and were printed in 1865 by P.S. Duval, a Philadelphia lithographer. An original drawing of this sort of treatment of the Constitution of the Confederate States of America shows the faces of Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, and Stonewall Jackson within the text. The drawing may well be by Swander as well.</p><p>Impressions of the United States Constitution include one printed in the 1830s by C. L. Adams &amp; Son in Boston. A statistical chart showing some results of the 1840 Sixth United States Census was also printed by C. L. Adams in 1844. One of the impressions of the Emancipation Proclamation was designed in 1864 by F. S. Butler, a 14 year old from San Francisco. Another is a vibrant chromolithograph by Max Rosenthal showing Civil War scenes and portraits of Generals. All impressions of that document date from 1864 and 1865.</p><p>Impressions of the Declaration of Independence date from as early as 1826 and include many after the design of John Binns, with ornamental seals representing the states of the Union and portraits of Washington, Jefferson, and Hancock. Several others were designed by Benjamin Owen Taylor and engraved by Peter Maverick. Many incorporate a vignette after Trumbull's "Declaration of Independence," including a hand-colored lithographed published in 1856 by J. C. Buttre of New York. A rare hand-colored engraving of the document by Humphrey Phelps was published in 1845.An impression published in 1876 celebrates 100 years of American Independence and includes vignettes of scenes from the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref94_fzz" level="file"><did><unittitle>DOMESTIC LIFE</unittitle><container id="aspace_527e4e46f9ea235126dc6ca2ee335527" label="Graphic Materials" type="Folder">x</container></did><odd id="aspace_158bfb4264bf087e449a5c91dbab5778"><head>General note</head><p>See also: Series III</p></odd></c><c id="aspace_ref96_luq" level="file"><did><unittitle>EDUCATION</unittitle><container id="aspace_189735a8e39b7b1f3670b1030fa757cf" label="Graphic Materials" type="Folder">x</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_baa65f28ee1fd4bb56c6af73fe54e382"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>includes plates numbers 1-5 and 9-12 of Louis Prang's "Trades and Occupations" set of his "Aids for Object Teaching," chromolithographs which he designed for educational use in 1874.

These include "The Life &amp; Age of Man," a broadside from ca. 1830 printed in both English and German, and a rare copy of the corresponding "Life &amp; Age of Woman." "Afro-Americans" includes broadsides and prints celebrating the 15th amendment to the Constitution, and several prints showing aspects of the slave trade. A folder of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" material is primarily prints of scenes from the book, most printed in France in 1854.</p><p>"Indians of North America" includes portraits and scenes of life, photographs, and prints. Any portrait or image of an Indian in which a tribe was named has been filed with others of that tribe. One folder of damaged photos includes a photograph by Edward Curtis. Most of the prints are lithographs by John T. Bowen and lithographs and engravings after the work of early 19th century artists Charles Karl Bodmer, George Catlin, Charles Bird King, and J. O. Lewis, and others. These are foldered by artist.</p><p>The engravings after Bodmer were published in London in 1839 and later, and seem to be plates from several different editions of Travels in the Interior of North America, 1832-1834, the published journals of the Maximilian-Bodmer expedition. This book was published in German, French, English; the plates are captioned all three languages. Most of these engravings are brilliantly hand-colored. The plates measure 13.5 by 21 inches and smaller.</p><p>Twenty lithographs by John T. Bowen were published by F. W. Greenough in 1836-1838 and 1842. Bowen was a prominent lithographer who produced the lithographs for Audubon's Birds of America, among other works. Bowen's illustrations of Native Americans were published in several of McKenney and Hall's popular books about Native Americans. These lithographs, while showing similar portraits to those in the books, appear to have been individually issued. They were "drawn, printed &amp; coloured" at Bowen's lithographic studio in Philadelphia.</p><p>Works associated with George Catlin include several facsimiles of notes and sketches made by Catlin on his visits with Native Americans, as well as Currier &amp; Ives prints after Catlin's paintings. Also included are two advertisements, one looking for subscribers for Catlin's North American Indian Portfolio. The second is an announcement in French of the coming appearance of the "O-jib-be-wa's," members of one of Catlin's European traveling Indian shows. A large portrait of Osceola was lithographed by Catlin himself in 1838, after his painting of the Seminole chief.</p><p>Several prints commemorate the visit in 1710 of four Iroquois kings to the court of Queen Anne of England. Individual full-length mezzotint portraits of each king by John Simon after paintings by John Verelst and bust-length portraits by Peter Schenck from paintings by John Faber are foldered together.</p><p>Several portraits were drawn from life by J. O. Lewis between 1825 and 1840 and lithographed by Bufford's Lithography in New York City. In addition, this folder includes a broadside published by Lewis in 1840 with a portrait and life history of Elkswattawa, "The Prophet of Tippecanoe."</p><p>Nine lithographs were hand-colored by Lehman &amp; Duval after paintings by Charles Bird King, and published by Key &amp; Biddle, 1833-1838. King painted Indian visitors to his studio in Washington, D.C. from 1821 to 1840s. Several hand-colored lithographs were drawn, colored and published by Daniel Rice &amp; James G. Clark in 1842-1843. "Indians of South America" is six colored engravings of Incan costumes from an 1809 French atlas, Voyages au Perou Faits Dans les Annees 1790-1794.</p><p>Photograph of women passengers in what appears to be a subway car, circa early 20th century.

"Railroads" is mainly comprised of photographs, some of these are of train engines. Copy photographs show the ceremonies for the laying of the last rail on the transcontinental railroad. "Dewitt Clinton" was the first steam-powered passenger train in New York. It traveled sixteen miles from Albany to Schenectady on the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad line in 1831. "Aircraft" includes a print from circa 1835 showing the "Prince's Aerial Ship. Star of the East!" a fanciful blimp-like structure outfitted like a cruise ship. Aircraft accidents is a folder of photographs showing the 1970 crash of a Trans International Airlines DC-8 plane at Kennedy Airport. "Automobiles" includes photos of early cars, and plates from Safety for Twenty Million Automobile Drivers, a how-to-drive manual from 1922. The photographs show a person doing driving maneuvers in New York street scenes. "Carriages &amp; coaches" is a large category that includes both photographs and prints.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref116_r1b" level="file"><did><unittitle>UNITED STATES--HISTORY</unittitle><container id="aspace_094019fa25b7e546ad19bea79dc66cff" label="Graphic Materials" type="Folder">x</container></did><odd id="aspace_43e44b2075465f75ee188e2948507d36"><head>General note</head><p>See also: Series III</p></odd><scopecontent id="aspace_0a812939bb0cb15f98f1d34ba5b6a758"><head>Scope and Contents Note</head><p>mainly historical prints depicting events (apart from wars) that are not found in any other category.

The bulk of this category is Civil War material. There is only a small amount of material from World Wars I and II. The "Pequot War" folder contains a plate from John Underhill's 1638 book Nevves from America showing the layout of an Indian fort.</p><p>"United States Revolution" includes a set of lithographs published by Strobridge in 1893 showing important events from the war. "War of 1812" includes many contemporary prints, including several French prints commemorating the Treaty of Ghent. Two early American lithographs of the Battle of the Thames, dated 1833 and ca. 1837, are also notable. One of these is hand colored. A contemporary broadside is illustrated with relief woodcuts and advertises The First Book of Remarkable Events of the Present American War. Another, similarly illustrated broadside is a prose account of the battle of New Orleans.</p><p>The "Crimean War" is represented by one contemporary photograph. The albumen print is 7.5 by 9.25 inches on a 12.25 by 15.5 mount, and appears to be part of a French series of photographs of the war. It is hand annotated "Sebastopol," and has a French title Tirailleurs Indigens sous les Armes, or Indigenous Riflemen in the Army. The soldiers are wearing Turkish costumes and turbans.</p><p>"Mexican War" contains an 1847 Army Portfolio with chromolithographs of scenes of the war after drawings by Captain D. P. Whiting of the 7th Infantry. "Battles and Campaigns" are almost all lithographs by Currier &amp; Ives or Sarony &amp; Major. A few prints appear to have been lithographed in Mexico by Mexican artists. Some of these are titled in English and Spanish. This category also contains two copies of a hand colored map, "Seat of War &amp; Battles," published in 1847 in New York by Ensign &amp; Thayer, with text about notable people and battles in the war.</p><p>The "United States Civil War" encompasses many types of material. Contemporary photographs were removed, as noted in Series I. "General" folders include sheet music for the "Maryland Guard Galop" and for "U.S. Army Calls - Military Quadrille." Several disbound pages of an album include reproductions of pro-Confederacy cartoons and caricatures and prints of scenes from the war. A broadside detailing the "Comparison of Products, Population, and Resources of the Free and Slave States" was published in Massachusetts in 1861. A diagram for how to knit army mittens, printed by John J. Hinchman &amp; Co., New York.</p><p>"Afro Americans" includes prints of African American soldiers and a flyer for Newark's celebration of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1906. "Campaigns &amp; Battles" are filed alphabetically and include many chromolithographs published ca. 1888 by Kurz &amp; Allison, as well as Charles Magnus' published views of battle sites around Richmond. "Military Facilities" includes prints showing volunteer refreshment saloons and a Brooklyn Sanitary Fair. "Camps" includes a camp-made paper flag from Camp Wadsworth in Spartenburg, South Carolina.</p><p>"Military life" includes 4 folders of plates from Edwin Forbes' Life Studies of the Great Army (1876), in which he etched forty different scenes, mostly views of soldiers, mainly at rest. "Military personnel" includes composite portraits of Union and Confederate generals and other army officers. Individual portraits of these men may be found in the portrait file.</p><p>Materials documenting the "Spanish American War" are mainly chromolithographs and published inserts, prints, and pages from Leslie's Weekly,  Harper's Weekly, and  Collier's Weekly periodicals. A "General" folder includes several of these inserts with American flags printed on them and text urging the recipient to "cut out flag and put in window." Also included is a broadside from 1904 detailing the "Cost of War and Warfare" by Edward Atkinson. Atkinson published several books and pamphlets on this same topic; this broadside may have served as a prospectus for these works. Material is organized by theaters of war. "Phillipines" includes many prints showing the Battle of Manila, and a few of the commemorative Dewey Arch erected in New York City.</p><p>"World War I" material is also primarily chromolithographs and newspaper inserts. One folder contains front covers of Leslie's Weekly from 1917-1918 while the magazine was running its series, "The War in Pictures." These covers are all patriotically illustrated, mainly by James Montgomery Flagg. Photos in this category include several of victory parades in New York.</p><p>"World War II" contains a few advertisements for wartime saving and other conservation minded appeals. Photographs taken (mainly by the U.S. government) during World War II were removed to PR 076 World War II Photography Collection.</p></scopecontent></c></c><c id="aspace_ref121_08d" level="series"><did><unittitle>Series III: Oversize Files</unittitle></did><scopecontent id="aspace_16326742cf85f9483a0a8cea4a6b5738"><head>Scope and Contents note</head><p>Series III includes  material that is larger than 24 by 40 inches.

Independence, and the Emancipation Proclamation, as well as several copies of southern states' secession
statements. There are several copies of a Declaration of Independence designed by John Binns, with
ornamental seals representing the states of the Union and Washington, Jefferson, and Hancock. A rare sheet
shows the Declaration of Independence surrounded by charts of statistical and historical information about
the United States, all within an ornamental arch and border. It was published by Humphrey Phelps and Bela
Squire in New York in October of 1832. A lithographed "Facsimile of the Emancipation Proclamation" was
issued in Chicago in 1863, to be sold for $2 each; the resulting money was to be used for the erection of a
permanent home for the sick and disabled soldiers of the Union Army. Lithographed copies of secession
ordinances, printed in the 1860s, are from Virginia, Louisiana (printed in English and French) and South
Carolina. Notable among other documents included here are a "Declaration of Sentiments, adopted by the
Peace Convention, held in Boston, September 18, 19, and 20, 1838;" a hand-colored "Pictorial History of the
United States" from 1846, and an illuminated parchment broadside with hand-calligraphy, a gift from the
