    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>The Accountants Club of America (ACA) traces its roots to about 1897 when accountants Charles Waldo Haskins and Elijah Watt Sells (of the firm Haskins and Sells, which later became part of the firm known by 2018 as Deloitte) advocated for informal gatherings of professional accountants. Such meetings were held in the ensuing decades culminating in 1927 with the incorporation of the ACA to provide an ongoing  vehicle for organizing the meetings. Although centered in New York City, "of America" was included in the name to give it national stature. The purpose of the Club, as stated in its by-laws, is "to provide an environment in which professional colleagues in the accounting profession and related fields can meet in a comfortable social setting to exchange ideas, thoughts and information of interest on topics of personal, business, social and professional issues." The organization runs various programs for its members, including speakers, roundtable discussions and social gatherings for networking.</p><p>Accountants Forum, Inc. (AFI) was formed in 1941 and is an affiliate of ACA. It is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization that provides financial support for ACA's programs. ACA and AFI share by-laws, officers, and other governance matters.</p>  </bioghist>
