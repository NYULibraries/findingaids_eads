            <abstract id="ref1" label="Abstract">Letter from attorney Richard A. Knight of New York City to the Bar Association's Committee on Grievances describing his complaints against the law firm of Carter, Ledyard &amp; Milburn; the Brooklyn Appellate Division of the New York state court; the Special Guardian appointed by the Appellate Court; and directors of the United States Trust Company. Knight's diatribe consists of accusations of fraud, tax evasion, incompetence, perjury, and systemic corruption. He cites the daughter of the deceased Lewis Cass Ledyard, Jr. as the victim of these crimes, though without disclosing that he is her husband and attorney in a lawsuit related to the complaints. Knight's charges range widely, including allegations of negligence on the part of Thomas E. Dewey, then-District Attorney of New York County and future presidential candidate. The 25 page letter appears to have been distributed by Knight to others in the legal profession; in addition to the complaint letter there is a one page covering "notice" justifying the grievance and an envelope addressed to the firm of Morris &amp; Co at 61 Broadway.
