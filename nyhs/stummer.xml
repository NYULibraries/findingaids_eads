            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Helen M. Stummer was born in 1936. She holds a bachelor's degree in fine arts from Kean College, and a masters degree in Visual Sociology from Vermont College. Before becoming a photographer, Stummer was a painter. She began taking photographs in 1975, enrolling in classes at the International Center for Photography in New York City, in order to better document subjects for her paintings.</p>
            <p>Stummer considers herself a Visual Sociologist. She has focused her camera on photographing economically disadvantaged communities, both in urban and rural settings. In addition to the photographs taken on East 6th Street found in this collection, she has documented inhabitants of the city of Newark, New Jersey, as well as communities in rural Maine and in Guatemala.</p>
            <p>Stummer's photographs have been widely published and exhibited. More information on Stummer can be found on her website, www.hmstummer.com.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Helen M. Stummer Photographs and Papers span the period from 1976 to 2001 and primarily contains photographs taken on East 6th Street in New York City. The collection also holds some of the photographer's archive relating to these photographs, including audiocassettes, a videocassette, an artist's book and a memoir.</p>
            <p>While Stummer was enrolled in photography classes at the International Center for Photography, she was encouraged to continue an earlier interest in photographing children. She arranged to go to the Children's Aid Society's Sloane Center on East 6th Street between Avenues B and C. At that time the street was considered part of the Lower East Side neighborhood, and was inhabited mainly by poor Puerto Rican and African American families. Stummer photographed children both inside the Center and outside on the streets. Over the course of several years, she befriended many East 6th Street residents, and photographed important events in their lives. She also conducted oral interviews with some of the people she met and photographed.</p>

                    <p>Series II. Archive material includes material from Stummer's archive of the East 6th Street photography project. This includes contact sheets, slides, audiotapes, a 9 minute U-Matic cartridge "Children of East 6th Street" (which seems to be of still images), and a handmade artist's book of photographs and reminiscences of the project. This material spans the period from 1976 to 1984. The series also includes a manuscript memoir by Stummer titled "Risking Life and Lens: How I Photographed the Meanest Street in America and Why."</p>
                    <p>One hundred and sixty printed contact sheets document the entirety of the images taken by Stummer on East 6th Street. Stummer's notes, as well as dates, are recorded on most of these. One hundred and sixty one slides, both black and white and Ektachrome, represent a selection of the images. Few are dated or labeled. The ten audiotapes include several that Stummer recorded of ambient noise on the block while she was taking photographs. It also includes a tape of her narration to a slide show of photos of East 6th Street. Several tapes are oral histories and interviews between Stummer and East 6th Street residents. One tape is an oral history interview with Irwin Silver concerning the September 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center.</p>
