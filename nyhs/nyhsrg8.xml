            <p>From its founding in 1804, N-YHS has publicized its institutional objectives, programs, galleries and exhibitions, publications, fundraising needs, and other matters. Indeed, N-YHS printed a public announcement of its mission in February 1805, just three months after its inaugural meeting. Printed appeals, newspaper advertisements, and other materials were produced throughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth. Publicity took on a special focus beginning about 1939 as N-YHS began to expand its programs and the professional staff to support them. The increased programming and staffing at that time was principally the result of the receipt of a substantial bequest from the Mary Gardiner Thompson estate. This bequest was used, in part, to complete the expansion of the Central Park West building and to fund the growth in staff size. Part of this growth was directed toward greater publicity about N-YHS's varied programs and for much of the following decades the Public Relations Department also held responsibility for conducting tours, school visits, film series, and other programs.</p>
            <p>Among N-YHS's publicity initiatives was increased outreach to the press, and this record group focuses on the press releases and, later, press kits that were produced. The first supervisor of these publicity initiatives was Alexander J. Wall, Jr., son of N-YHS's then-director. Wall Jr. left the position to serve in the military during World War II, returning in 1945. While he was away, the work was continued by others, including Dorothy Barck and Richard Baker, editors of N-YHS's publications. Wall Jr. left N-YHS about 1950 and Meryle Evans took the publicity position for about six years. Evans was succeeded by Susan McMahon in 1957, George Sykes in 1960, Richard Cunliffe in 1963, and Lawrence Skutch in 1968. After Skutch's departure about 1972 through the end of the date range of this record group in 1994, various individuals appear as contacts on press releases including Joyce Crawford (circa 1976-1979), Edith Sakell (circa 1979-1983), Gail Rentsch (circa 1983-1986), Nancy Donner (circa 1986-1992), and Jennifer Carlson.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
            <p>This record group contains press releases and press kits produced by the New-York Historical Society’s Public Relations Department between 1941 and 1993, with some subsequent material to 2006, and distributed to various publications. The releases contain information about recent acquisitions, staff appointments, the N-YHS’s mission and collecting policy, current exhibitions, children’s programs, lectures, film and concert series, and other events at the institution. There are few press releases from after 1993, and these are principally print-outs from N-YHS's website. Press kits were folders of press releases and other documents with facts about N-YHS exhibitions, such as brief historical context and dates, and other events.</p>

            <head>Processing Information Note</head>
            <p>The public relations files were processed perhaps circa 2000, with documents transferred from original folders to archival containers. In July 2015, archival intern Margaret Kaczorowski implemented additional processing steps, created the inventory and other descriptive notes, and produced this finding aid. Some additional material, mostly post-1993, was added by project archivist Larry Weimer in 2016.</p>

            <p>This finding aid relates to just one record group of the New-York Historical Society archives. For information about the other record groups and for overall information about the archives, please see the

Other record groups that are processed and available to researchers and are especially related to the New-York Historical Society public relations material (NYHS-RG 8) are as follows:</p>
            <p>Over the course of its history, N-YHS produced a variety of documents publicizing its programs and operations. Many of these brochures, fliers, posters, calendars, and other matter can be found in the New-York Historical Society ephemera record group (NYHS-RG 14).</p>
            <p>For a perspective on the press coverage N-YHS received in the New York and national press, especially from 1870 and into the late twentieth century, see the New-York Historical Society press clippings record group (NYHS-RG 7).</p>

                    <p>This series is arranged chronologically. The bulk of the releases appear to have come from the original files of the Public Relations Department, but these have been filled out with additional copies by releases found by the archivists in the files of other departments.</p>

                    <head>Scope and Contents Note</head>
                    <p>This series includes press releases distributed by N-YHS to various publications from 1941-1993, primarily publicizing the institution's public events, such as exhibitions, lectures, film series, school programs, and walking tours. These materials include fact sheets, schedules and calendars of events, checklists, exhibition contributor biographies, brochures, and other background information. This information often includes historical and other context related to the publicized program; examples include a "Sampler of Ballroom Etiquette" from a 1988 exhibition. The series includes a small amount of material from prior to 1941 and after 1993.</p>
                    <p>Press releases also concern N-YHS organizational matters, such as new collection acquisitions, changes in senior management positions, the establishment of a new conservation program, and fundraising initiatives, such as the announcement for N-YHS's first ever major fundraising gala in 1988. The final press releases of the series, from 1993, concern N-YHS's efforts to resolve its financial troubles.</p>
                    <p>Particularly for the 1980s-1990s, the files include so-called "press round-ups." These were summaries compiled by N-YHS of the coverage in the press of N-YHS exhibitions and other events.</p>

                    <p>This series includes press kits on exhibitions produced by the New-York Historical Society dating between 1976 and 1994. The press kits typically contain press releases and fact sheets, with basic information such as names of contacts, sponsors, and curators, opening events, and a brief historical background of the subject. Many kits include additional documents, such as programs, checklists, brochures, and photographs concerning each exhibition. The exhibitions were an eclectic mix of themes, ranging from the portrayal of domestic life in 19th century America to exhibitions of the work of artists and photographers to the opening of the N-YHS conservation lab.</p>
