    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Jacob M. "Jack" Gutzeit (1921-2003) was, in the context of this collection, an amateur radio operator, known by the call sign W2LZX. He was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY, and as a married man in the 1940s, moved to Flushing, Queens, where he lived for 60 years. He died in Delray Beach, Florida.</p><p>Gutzeit became interested in electronics as a teenager and built his own radio tubes. He became a licensed amateur, or "ham," radio operator in 1939. During World War II, Gutzeit enlisted with the Army in 1943 and was assigned to the 897th Signal Company in the Pacific theater. After the 897th was assigned to the Air Force's 81st Air Depot group, he served as a radioman on B-17s. He was discharged from the military at the end of the war at the rank of sergeant.</p><p>Gutzeit was engaged with electronics throughout his life, as a teacher at Brooklyn Technical School, as a salesman of electronic devices and components, and as senior advertising manager for QSL Magazine. He obtained a private pilot's license in the 1950s, flying a Cessna 172 along the East Coast. He was an award-winning radio operator and a member of the American Radio Relay League (ARRL).</p><p>Gutzeit married Ruth Rakoff in 1942, shortly before heading to war. They had two children, Sande and Howard; Sande arranged the donation of this collection to N-YHS.</p><p>(The above note is based on a biographical note included by the donor with the collection.)</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Contents</head>
<p>The collection includes records compiled during much of Jack Gutzeit's career as an amateur radio operator. These primarily include QSL cards sent to Gutzeit from around the world, acknowledging his transmissions. By the donor's count, there are 12,034 cards. The bulk of the cards were directed to Gutzeit's call sign of W2LZX; about 1200 were directed to four other call signs Gutzeit used when operating under other licenses at offshore locations in the Caribbean. The cards were skimmed during processing for date range; the bulk appears to be from the 1970s-1990s, with a few extending back to the 1940s. Beyond the essential facts of the acknowledged transmission, the cards portray a variety of artwork, photographs, and text that center variously on the originating locale and/or radio operator/team of operators.</p><p>The collection also holds Gutzeit's logs of transmissions from 1974-2001, with an earlier log for a brief period in 1955. There are also a few documents related to ham operator organizations and Gutzeit's personal QSL cards.</p>  </scopecontent>
