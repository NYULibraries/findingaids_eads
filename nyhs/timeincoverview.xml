            <p>Henry Robinson Luce and Briton Hadden met while classmates at the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut. They became friends while working on rival school publications, they became friends. Both went on to Yale University and joined the Yale 
                <title render="italic">Daily News</title> as freshmen. After graduation in 1920, Luce and Hadden went their separate ways. Luce traveled, briefly studied at Oxford, and worked at 
                <title render="italic">The Chicago Daily News</title>. Hadden also traveled and worked at 
                <title render="italic">The New York World</title>. Ultimately both ended up working at 
                <title render="italic">The Baltimore News</title> in 1922. There they conceived of the magazine that became 
                <title render="italic">Time</title>, with the working title 
                <title render="italic">Facts</title>, before forming Time, Incorporated on November 28, 1922 in New York. They published the first issue on March 3, 1923 with a circulation of around 9,000. Luce and Hadden alternated as President of the company, but shared the masthead as Managing Editors. Hadden died suddenly in 1929. Luce died in 1967.</p>
            <p>Besides the flagship magazine, Time Inc. also launched 
                <title render="italic">Fortune</title>, 
                <title render="italic">Life</title>, 
                <title render="italic">Sports Illustrated</title>, and 
                <title render="italic">People</title>, along with the radio news program 
                <title render="italic">March of Time</title>. Time Inc. created divisions for wider entertainment offerings such as Time-Life Books and the cable television channel Home Box Office, later known as HBO. Time Inc. also acquired companies such as publisher Little, Brown and Company, and lumber company Temple Industries; and publications such as 
                <title render="italic">Architectural Forum</title>. In 1990, Time Inc. merged with Warner Communications Inc. resulting in Time Warner. Time Inc., the magazine publishing branch, separated from Time Warner in 2014.</p>

                    <p>The Time Inc. Subject Files contain materials that document the history of Time Inc. as an organization. Within the record group, the materials focus on three main areas: corporate, editorial, and publishing. Corporate covers the acquisition and sale of entities as well as contracts and agreements between organizations, negotiations, board meetings, and other similar business relations. Editorial relates to the work being done by correspondents, reporters, and researchers. Publishing includes everything from advertising and promotion to production and circulation. While the corporate, editorial, and publishing materials are generally separated from each other, there are instances where they are interfiled. The records cover the various departments, magazines, publishers, and subsidiary corporations that operate under the Time Inc. umbrella.</p>
                    <p>Some of the topics covered are the Cold War, contract negotiations, the United States’ foreign and domestic policies, the creation of job descriptions, establishment of an employee health care plan and stock options, hiring guidelines, human resources conflicts related to race and gender, internal and external criticisms, intergovernmental relations, the involvement of the magazine and staff in national political campaigns, lawsuits involving Time Inc., magazine censorship, male employee draft status, manpower problems during World War II, participation in the newspaper guild, proposals for new advertising campaigns, regional political and economic developments, and strategies to boost circulation.</p>

                    <p>The Time Inc. Bio Files were assembled and maintained by the Time Inc. Archives and predominately document the careers of Time Inc. staff from board members (H. P. Davison) and company executives (John S. Martin, Ray Cave, Hedley Donovan, Elizabeth Valk Long) to administrative assistants. The files represent staff from all divisions, departments and subsidiaries including
