<emph render="bold">HISTORY OF TIME INC.</emph><lb/>

<p>For a comprehensive history of Time Inc. and its founders, see the authorized histories of Time Inc. listed in the citations at the end.</p>

<p>Henry Robinson Luce and Briton Hadden met while classmates at the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut. They became friends while working on rival school publications. Both went on to Yale University and joined the Yale <title render="italic">Daily News</title> as freshmen. After graduation in 1920, Luce and Hadden went their separate ways. Luce traveled, briefly studied at Oxford, and worked at <title render="italic">The Chicago Daily News</title>. Hadden also traveled and worked at <title render="italic">The New York World</title>. Ultimately both ended up working at <title render="italic">The Baltimore News</title> in 1922.</p>

<p>There they conceived of the magazine that became <title render="italic">Time</title>, with the working title <title render="italic">Facts</title>, before forming Time, Incorporated on November 28, 1922 in New York. They published the first issue on March 3, 1923 with a circulation of around 9,000. Luce and Hadden alternated as President of the company, but shared the masthead as Managing Editors. Hadden died suddenly in 1929. Luce died in 1967.</p>

<p>Besides the flagship magazine, Time Inc. also launched <title render="italic">Fortune</title>, <title render="italic">Life</title>, <title render="italic">Sports Illustrated</title>, and <title render="italic">People</title>, along with the radio news program <title render="italic">March of Time</title>. Time Inc. created divisions for wider entertainment offerings such as Time-Life Books and the cable television channel Home Box Office, later known as HBO, and subsidiaries to handle the technical side of printing such as Printing Developments, Inc. Time Inc. also acquired companies such as publisher Little, Brown and Company, and lumber company Temple Industries; and publications such as <title render="italic">Architectural Forum</title> and the Washington <title render="italic">Star</title>. In 1990, Time Inc. merged with Warner Communications Inc. resulting in Time Warner. Time Inc., the magazine publishing branch, separated from Time Warner in 2014.</p>

<lb/>
<emph render="bold">ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CORPORATE ARCHIVES</emph>
<lb/>

<p>The earliest documentation regarding the establishment of the Time Inc. Archives dates from 1941, when a proposal was sent to one of the company's top executives, stating, "We are in favor of starting a confidential file of Archives, which can be kept up to date and which, as time goes on, should prove invaluable for...a comprehensive history of the company...Things we'd like to save:  original dummies, prospectuses, and first copies of all the magazines, complete sets of annual reports, complete and up to date material on H.R.L. and his writings, a complete set of all company bulletins, pictures, diaries and personal accounts of all early employees, etc...But there is at present, so far as I know, no systematic effort to keep track of all documents which have long range value to the company...Main thing I am anxious to establish is the habit of saving valuable material.  If you approve the project, we can start delving almost at once." </p>

<p>In 1950, after passing through the hands of several long time employees, the Archives Department was formally established, reporting up to the company's Central Services division.</p>
 
<lb/>
<emph render="bold">REASON FOR ESTABLISHING ARCHIVES</emph><lb/>

<p>One of the guiding reasons for establishing the Archive was, as noted above, that as early as 1941, Time Inc. was considering a "comprehensive history of the company."  A memo in an Archives folder in the Reference Files, from April 1950, expresses the desire for a "definitive, scholarly history of Time Inc."  Three authorized histories have been published so far:</p>


<p>Elson, Robert T. 1968. <title render="italic">Time, Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise, 1923-1941</title>. New York: Atheneum.</p>

<p>Elson, Robert T., and Duncan Norton-Taylor. 1973. <title render="italic">The World of Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Publishing Enterprise, 1941-1960</title>. New York: Atheneum.</p>

<p>Prendergast, Curtis, and Geoffrey Colvin. 1986. <title render="italic">The World of Time Inc.: The Intimate History of a Changing Enterprise, 1960-1980</title>. New York: Atheneum.</p>

<p>According to Robert T. Elson, "Luce had a very strong sense of history, and a feeling that Time Inc. was a unique institution.  What he wanted was a record of the men and women who worked there."</p>    <chronlist>

Subject Files contain materials that document the history of Time Inc. as an organization. Within the record group, the materials focus on three main areas: corporate, editorial, and publishing. Corporate covers the acquisition and sale of entities as well as contracts and agreements between organizations, negotiations, board meetings, and other similar business relations. Editorial relates to the work being done by correspondents, reporters, and researchers. Publishing includes everything from advertising and promotion to production and circulation. While the corporate, editorial, and publishing materials are generally separated from each other, there are instances where they are interfiled. The records cover the various departments, magazines, publishers, and subsidiary corporations that operate under the Time Inc. umbrella.</p><p>Some of the topics covered are the Cold War, contract negotiations, the United States' foreign and domestic policies, the creation of job descriptions, establishment of an employee health care plan and stock options, hiring guidelines, human resources conflicts related to race and gender, internal and external criticisms, intergovernmental relations, the involvement of the magazine and staff in national political campaigns, lawsuits involving Time Inc., magazine censorship, male employee draft status, manpower problems during World War II, participation in the newspaper guild, proposals for new advertising campaigns, regional political and economic developments, and strategies to boost circulation.</p><p><blockquote><p>Click here to link to the <extref actuate="onRequest"

Bio Files were assembled and maintained by the Time Inc. Archives and predominately document the careers of Time Inc. staff from board members (H. P. Davison) and company executives (John S.

Time Inc. also kept files on non-staff closely associated with the company, and some family and former classmates of cofounders Henry R. Luce and Briton Hadden in relation to interviews during various history and biography projects. This record group includes the collection's primary files on cofounder Hadden.</p><p>Contents consist of correspondence; memoranda regarding new hires, departing staff and other staffing changes; press releases; news clippings including obituaries; articles from the staff newsletters; articles or correspondent cables by or about staff; reports and comments on articles and books under consideration for publication; invitations to events; and speeches or other public remarks.
