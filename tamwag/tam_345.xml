            <p>May Mandelbaum Edel was an anthropologist who carried out field work in Africa and was an educator of high school students. May's husband, Abraham Edel, was an American philosopher and ethicist with whom she collaborated on some publications.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>The documents in the collection include clippings, correspondence, notes, flyers, pamphlets and speeches. Some of the documents concern Edel's professional work as an anthropologist, but the majority of the materials concern her work as a peace activist and as a member of the Teacher's Union, particularly in cases of academic freedom at Brooklyn College. Some of the documents also have to do with the work of May's husband, Abraham Edel, and include materials on anti-semitism at the City College of New York, the Rapp-Courdet Committee, and public statements by Morris Schappes on academic freedom. A later donation includes 3 letters from 1957 between May Edel and Charles Greene on academic freedom vs. an anti-communism ruling in the Great Neck Adult School. Overall the documents span from 1929 to the 1950s. An additional donation contains two articles relating to childhood education written in 1938 and 1944.</p>
