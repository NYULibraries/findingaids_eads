            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The Tamiment Library Web Collection on Organizations, first began by Tamiment in 2007, contains webpages of organizations and other entities concerned with issues related to economic, civil, and social justice from a left and/or progressive perspective. This is an assembled collection, the websites were selected by the archivists. These entities focus on issues ranging from corporate accountability, immigrant rights, unemployment, homelessness, urban justice, healthcare reform, wealth redistribution, and other issues. The collection also contains websites related to environmental and green movements, prisoner rights, the Jewish American Left, peace movements, art and cultural organizations, education and youth movements, animal rights, feminism, housing rights, and other websites related to the Left movement. Tamiment also archives political websites, focusing on Marxian inspired entities, including political parties that identify with or are inspired by Communist, Socialist, or Trotskyist perspectives.</p>
            <p>In addition, there is a huge focus in this collection on the Occupy Wall Street Movement, established in September 2011. Occupy Wall Street is a social movement, started in New York City, that works to reform both the private and public sector. The websites in the collection focus on different aspects and working groups of the movement. Another huge focus of the collection contains websites of those critical of U.S. policy in relation to Guantanamo Detention Camp and its representation governing enemy combatants, prisoner interrogation, the related legal processes and issues, the global detention system established by the Bush administration, including efforts to secure civil and human rights for detainees. Contents include prisoners' testimony and documents from attorneys defending them.</p>
            <p>These websites contain a huge variety of media, which include videos, pdfs, blog postings (including Tumblr and Wordpress blogs), petitions, news feeds, message boards (or forums), and audio. These websites often act to document and update upon the organizations’ activities, schedule upcoming events, build awareness of their cause or organization, information on projects the organizations are working on, writings and articles by members of the organization or party, or other activities.</p>
            <p>The web collection documents the publicly available content of the web page, it does not archive material that is password protected or blocked due to robot txt exclusions. Although Tamiment attempts to archive the entirety of a website, certain file types will not be captured dependent on how they are embedded in the site. This can include videos (Youtube, Vimeo, or otherwise), pdfs (including Scribd or another pdf reader), rss feeds/plug-ins (including twitter), commenting platforms (disqus, facebook), presi, images, or anything that is not native to the site.</p>

            <p>Tamiment Library, New York University began web archiving in 2007 as part of a grant given by the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIPP) of the Library of Congress. As most unions, left movements, progressive organizations, and others stop creating ephemeral material and paper based collections and move most of their administrative and informational material to the web, Tamiment continued to document the changing face of the labor and left movement into the web era. Tamiment uses the California Digital Library’s Web Archiving Service (WAS) as their tool to capture and preserve websites. WAS was created in 2007 and Tamiment is one of its earliest partners. The California Digital Library provides the storage and infrastructure for the project.</p>

            <p>Due to technical or privacy issues, archived websites may not be exact copies of the original website at the time of the web crawl. Certain file types will not be captured dependent on how they are embedded in the site. This can include videos (including Youtube and Vimeo), pdfs (including Scribd or another pdf reader), rss feeds/plug-ins (including Twitter), commenting platforms (disqus, Facebook), presi, images, or anything that is not native to the site. Other parts of websites that the crawler has difficulty capturing includes Javascript, streaming content, database-driven content, and highly interactive content. Robot txt exclusions also change the formatting of websites from their original display, websites with robot txt exclusions often display as an index.</p>
            <p>Keyword and file-type search are also available to archived websites through the Web Archiving Service (WAS). To search for keywords within archived websites, click a site name link in the container list. From that page, click the "search" tab on the top left corner.

            <head>Processing Information note</head>
            <p>Tamiment Library uses the California Digital Library’s Web Archiving Service (WAS) to capture websites for historical purposes. Tamiment archivists select websites for capture based on Tamiment’s collecting policy. After the site is added, the title of the site is sometimes changed to better reflect the name of the organization/project/event/site.</p>
            <p>Sites are copied by what are commonly known as spiders, robots, or crawlers to index the website. WAS uses the Heritrix web crawler to copy (or capture) the website at a scheduled time and displays only an archived copy of the website. In general, the host page of website is captured for up to 36 hours. The initial capture of a website often includes the archived version of websites that have been linked to by the host website. Websites are crawled quarterly, unless contemporary events cause rapid change to content on a website.</p>
            <p>The archivist describes each site using subject headings, a brief description of the site and its contents, and tags. WAS arranges the websites alphabetically and preserves the websites.</p>
            <p>In 2014, finding aids were created from the 23 original projects. Original projects were collected by topic and continue to be maintained by the archivists. Three finding aids were created based on Tamiment Library's Printed Ephemera collection categories, to provide better access across websites and collections in Tamiment Library. These finding aids were created using the XML export tool in WAS and manipulated to create DACS-compliant EAD finding aids.</p>

                    <p>We support President Obama's executive order to close the Guantanamo prison. But it must be closed not just on paper, but in reality. After seven years of detaining hundreds of men without trial, a one year timeline for closing Guantanamo is unacceptable. For the over 70 men currently on hunger strike in Guantanamo, it has been seven years too long. We want justice now. Witness Against Torture announces a campaign to close the U.S. detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and end torture and rendition by the U.S. within the first 100 days of the new administration. With Barack Obama taking office, we have a historic opportunity to reverse the disastrous policies of the last eight years.</p>

                    <p>ALEC Exposed is a wiki website, established by the Center for Media and Democracy in 2011, showcasing 800 "model" and resolutions secretly voted on by corporations and politicians through the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Some bills were introduced in legislatures on the state level without disclosing that they were previously drafted and voting on by corporations and politicians. ALEC bills address a host of issues, including worker and consumer rights, education, taxes, health care, and immigration, often directly benefiting large corporations. The website works to analyze and annotate the bills to make them understandable to readers and provides factsheets and reasoning as to why the bills are harmful to the democratic processes of the United States. The website separates the bills into topics, including worker and consumer rights; tort reform and injured Americans; privatizing schools and higher education policy; health and pharmaceutical, and safety net programs; environment, energy, and agriculture; democracy, voter rights, and federal power; taxes and budgets; and guns, prisons, crime, and investigation. The website contains the bills, background information on ALEC, news, and analysis.</p>

                    <p>We are finally beginning to learn the full scope of the Bush administration's torture program. Government documents show that hundreds of prisoners were tortured in the custody of the CIA and Department of Defense, some of them killed in the course of interrogations. Justice Department memos show that the torture policies were devised and developed at the highest levels of the Bush administration. The ACLU is committed to restoring the rule of law. We will fight for the disclosure of the torture files that are still secret. We will advocate for the victims of the Bush administration's unlawful policies. We will press Congress to appoint a select committee that can investigate the roots of the torture program and recommend legislative changes to ensure that the abuses of the last eight years are not repeated. And we will advocate for the appointment of an independent prosecutor to examine issues of criminal responsibility.</p>

                    <p>National Security: SAFE AND FREE AT HOME There has never been a more urgent need to preserve fundamental privacy protections and our system of checks and balances than the need we face today, as illegal government spying, provisions of the Patriot Act and government-sponsored torture programs transcend the bounds of law and our most treasured values in the name of national security. Throughout U.S. history "national security" has often been used as a pretext for massive violations of individual rights. The terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 mobilized our country in the fight against terrorism. However, this also launched a serious civil liberties crises. The ACLU continues to challenge policies like the USA Patriot Act, and creates campaigns like Safe and Free.</p>

                    <p>The American Constitution Society for Law and Policy (ACS) is a progressive legal organization that promotes the U.S. Constitutional values of individual rights and liberties, genuine equality, access to justice, democracy and the rule of law. ACS was formed in 2001 at Georgetown Law Center by then-law professor Peter J. Rubin, in part as a counterweight to the conservative Federalist Society’s “original intent” interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. ACS has 13,000 members, 165 student chapters and lawyer chapters in 32 cities. The organization promotes and facilitates discussion and debate of progressive public policy ideas and issues, providing forums for legal scholars, lawmakers, judges, lawyers, public policy advocates, law students and members of the media.</p>

                    <p>The American Friends Service Committee carries out service, development, social justice, and peace programs throughout the world. Founded by Quakers ( A pacifist Christian denomination) in 1917 to provide conscientious objectors with an opportunity to aid civilian war victims. AFSC's work is based on the Quaker belief in the worth of every person and faith in the power of love to overcome violence and injustice. The organization's mission and achievements won worldwide recognition in 1947 when it accepted the Nobel Peace Prize with the British Friends Service Council on behalf of all Quakers. Some of the American Friends Service Committee’s campaigns include withdrawing US troops, eliminating nuclear weapons, transforming the criminal justice system, reforming immigration policy, and other campaigns to foster peace in communities.</p>

Since then, the Prospect has grown into a print journal with an average monthly readership of some 100,000, a special in-depth report in most issues, and a daily Web magazine with nearly 1 million unique monthly visitors. The magazine's goals are to demonstrate that progressive ideas could animate a majority politics; to energize civic democracy and give voice to the disenfranchised; and to counteract the growing influence of conservative media.</p>

                    <p>The Animal Liberation Front (ALF) carries out non-violent direct action against animal abuse in the form of rescuing animals and causing financial loss to animal exploiters, usually through the damage and destruction of property. ALF's goal is to save as many animals as possible and directly disrupt the practice of animal abuse to eventually end all animal suffering by forcing animal abuse companies (agribusiness, laboratories, etc.) out of business. Because ALF actions may be against the law, activists work anonymously, either in small groups or individually, and do not have any centralized organization or coordination. The ALF also advocates veganism or vegetarianism.</p>

The website publishes contemporary immigration detention coverage that grew out of their investigative report on the Corrections Corporation of America in 2008. They sought to present a picture of how the nation’s largest private prison company had partnered with the federal government to detain close to a million undocumented immigrants until they were deported, and in the process fill their empty beds and increase revenue. The website aggregates news on immigration detention.</p>

Orginally, the campaign engaged Western peace activists in the defense of the rights of democratic dissidents in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and enlisted East-bloc human rights activists against anti-democratic U.S. policies in countries like Nicaragua and Chile. The majority of the Campaign’s work has been its efforts to work with dissidents and social justice movements worldwide, and to forge alliances between them and progressive movements in the United States. The website contains petitions, endorsements, action alerts, news analysis, and endorsements.</p>

The document is extensive and includes, in addition to text various forms, identity cards and even Muslim burial instructions. It is signed by Major General Miller, who Donald Rumsfeld later sent to Abu Ghraib to "Gitmoize it". The document is also the subject of an ongoing legal action between the ACLU, which has been trying to obtain it, and the Department of Defense, which has withheld it in full.

                    <p>The Chelsea Manning Support Network is an organization dedicated to freeing Private Chelsea (formerly Bradley) Manning from serving a 35 year prison sentence for providing classified information to WikiLeaks. In August 2013, the organization changed its name when Manning announced she would like to begin to be known publicly by the name of Chelsea Elizabeth Manning, pursue hormone therapy, and be referred to with female pronouns. In 2014, the organization changed its name from the Private Manning Support Network to the Chelsea Manning Support Network. The organization raises funds for Manning, posts news about Manning and on other cases related to government surveillance and whistle-blowing, as well as a campaign to pardon Manning. The website also contains a significant amount of information on the trial that took place in 2013.</p>

                    <p>The Committees on Correspondence was organized in 1992 after the 1991 Communist Party USA convention as a non-Leninist, democratic socialist organization to dispute the policies and leadership of CPUSA head, Gus Hall. The movement centered around veteran communist and former leading CP official, Gil Green (1906-1997). The Committees on Correspondence sought to reach out to others on the left outside the Party, and held conferences in 1992 and 1994 to formally establish the new organization. Around 2000, the Committee on Correspondence changed its name to the Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism. The website contains information on their conventions, publications, including their newsletter, the Mobilizer, by- laws, and other materials.</p>

                    <p>The Communist Party of the United States of America (CPUSA) is a Marxist-Leninist political organization that was founded in Chicago in 1919. The CPUSA played a pivotal role in many significant political and social movements of the 20th century. Its Party platform focused largely on working class issues such as fair wages and unemployment, civil rights for racial and ethnic minorities, civil liberties for politically persecuted communities, economic justice for the poor, the unemployed and for immigrants, and international peace efforts. The Party’s work left an indelible mark in the arena of progressive politics and made it an influential force in the labor movement, particularly from the 1920s to the 1940s. Its varied political, social, and cultural initiatives attracted the support of a number of prominent artists, intellectuals, and activists, including Woody Guthrie, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Angela Davis. Though the CPUSA’s strength and size declined sharply following World War II and the advent of the Cold War and McCarthyism, it remains committed to socialism, peace, economic and social justice, and civil rights and liberties. Today, the CPUSA continues its struggle for socialism, peace, and social and economic justice, and publishes a newspaper, the People’s Weekly World (http://webarchives.cdlib.org/site/sw11834j9g), a monthly journal, Political Affairs (http://webarchives.cdlib.org/site/sw1r49hs90), and through its Labor Commission, the online periodical Labor Upfront (captured here: http://webarchives.cdlib.org/site/spec:0000000z7). The website contains a blog, event listings, action alerts, and other writings.</p>

                    <p>The Crimes of War Project (established in 1999 as a private, non-profit corporation) is a collaboration of journalists, lawyers and scholars dedicated to raising public awareness of the laws of war and their application to situations of conflict. Their goal is to promote understanding of international humanitarian law among journalists, policymakers, and the general public, in the belief that a wider knowledge of the legal framework governing armed conflict will lead to greater pressure to prevent breaches of the law, and to punish those who commit them. They seek to raise raise the level of understanding about the law among those reporting on war and war crimes; provide information for journalists, scholars, and the policy community about critical issues in modern armed conflict; encourage wider appreciation of international law as a framework for understanding and responding to conflicts around the world; promote consultation among journalists, legal experts and humanitarian agencies about how to increase compliance with international humanitarian law; and provide a forum for accessible debate about the current state of international law. The website contains a glossary, commentary arranged by region, and other articles. The website last updated in 2011.</p>

Deep Dish TV is committed to democratizing media by providing a national forum for programming created by community-based organizations and independent producers. Their programs are shown on over 200 public access cable stations around the country, on selected PBS stations, and received by thousands of satellite dish viewers nationwide on Free Speech TV channel 9415 on the DishNetwork and LinkTV on DirecTV.</p>

                    <p>The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) was founded in 1983 as the result of the Merger of the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee, founded in 1973 by Michael Harrington (1928-1989). He led the DSA until his death, and the New American Movement, a New Left organization founded in the early 1970s. DSA is affiliated with the Socialist International. The party’s platform calls for reforms that weaken the influence of corporations in politics and give more power to working people. The website contains information on their campaigns and programs, which include student debt alleviation, immigrant rights, and the protection of social programs. The website also contains meeting minutes, chapter information, their publication, Democratic Left, their blog, Talking Union, their scholarship fund, and event listings.</p>

                    <p>The Democratic Strategist, founded by William Galston, Stan Greenberg and Ruy Teixeira in 2006, is a monthly publication that believes that Democrats must begin to develop political strategies that look beyond the standard two- and four-year time horizons set by the American electoral calendar. Democrats must develop a set of concrete and coherent political strategies for regularly winning elections and over the longer term -- perhaps over a decade or more -- winning new areas of support and creating nothing less than a stable Democratic majority in the country. The Democratic Strategist also seeks to be a forum for discussion of long-term political strategy.</p>

Fracking is the process of initiating and subsequently propagating a fracture in a rock layer, by means of a pressurized fluid, in order to release petroleum, natural gas, coal seam gas, or other substances for extraction. Frack Action works to raise awareness, expose false claims of the gas industry, and mobilize to protect the environment and public health from the environmental consequences of fracking.</p>

Free Speech TV is based in Denver, CO and is produced by Public Communicators Inc., founded in 1974. Promoting voices and perspectives under-represented in the media, Free Speech TV broadcasts independently-produced programs addressing social, political, cultural, and environmental issues, and produced the SourceCode series (2004-2007).</p>

                    <p>The George Polk Awards in Journalism, established in 1949, are a series of journalism awards presented annually by Long Island University in New York. Polk, a CBS correspondent, was murdered during a Greek civil war while trying to reach the guerrilla leader Markos Vafiades for an interview. The circumstances of his death, and the investigations that were conducted following the discovery of his body in Salonika Bay, are matters of continuing speculation and controversy. The website lists the winners of the award, gives details on the nomination process, and gives information on the yearly Polk seminar. Note: The Tamiment Library, NYU holds the papers of the Newsmen's Committee to Investigate the Murder of George Polk, and a collection of papers of George Polk.</p>

IVAW calls for an immediate withdrawal of all forces out of Iraq, reparations for the human and structural damages Iraq has suffered, and full benefits, adequate healthcare (including mental health), and other supports for returning servicemen and women. The website contains information on their committees and campaigns, chapter listings, information on individual members, and a blog.</p>

                    <p>Jewish Peace Fellowship (JPF) was established in 1941, as a nondenominational pacifist organization based upon their interpretation of Jewish social values. JPF was founded to support Jewish conscientious objectors, and to help educate local draft boards --accustomed only to the Christian roots of conscientious objection--of the theological basis of the Jewish position on conscientious objection. JPF supports Jewish resistance to the arms race in the United States, Israel, and the world. The organization also opposes capital punishment, conscription, the Israeli occupation of Palestine, and other U.S. armed interventions.</p>

                    <p>LeftShift.org was formed in June 2005 with the goal of showing solidarity with revolutionary Cuba against the ever-present imperialist threats from Washington, DC and Miami. Left Shift also tries to educate the US public about Cuba and its revolution, the nature of the threats against it, and opportunities for our visitors (audience) to get involved in the solidarity movement. While the current focus is Cuba, LeftShift.org stands in solidarity with all people under the gun of U.S. and U.S.-backed imperialism–from Afghanistan to Haiti to Iraq to Palestine to Venezuela–as well as communities under attack within the borders of the U.S.</p>

                    <p>Links International Journal of Socialist Renewal is an academic journal for the Left in the post-Cold War era. The journal aims to foster discussion and dialogue between Marxists and socialists from different political traditions. It seeks to bring together those in the international left who are opposed to neoliberal economic and social policies, and reject the bureaucratic model of "socialism" that arose in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and China. The publishers promote a socialism that's green, feminist and anti-racism. The website contains articles, past issues of the publication, and news listings.</p>

                    <p>On January 21, 2010, with its ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the Supreme Court ruled once again that corporations are persons, entitled by the U.S. Constitution to buy elections and run our government. Human beings are people; corporations are legal fictions. We, the People of the United States of America, reject the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling, and move to amend our Constitution to firmly establish that money is not speech, and that human beings, not corporations, are persons entitled to constitutional rights.</p>

                    <p>The Cuban Five (Gerardo Hernández, Antonio Guerrero, Ramón Labañino, Fernando González, and René González) are five Cubans convicted in Miami of conspiracy to commit espionage, conspiracy to commit murder, and other illegal activities in the United States. The Five were allegedly in the United States to observe and infiltrate the Cuban-American groups Alpha 66, the F4 Commandos, the Cuban American National Foundation, and Brothers to the Rescue. The Five appealed their convictions and the alleged lack of fairness in their trial. A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta overturned their convictions in 2005, citing the "prejudices" of Miami’s anti-Castro Cubans, but the full court later reversed the five's bid for a new trial and reinstated the original convictions. In June 2009 the US Supreme Court declined to review the case. In Cuba, the Five are viewed as national heroes and portrayed as having sacrificed their liberty in the defense of their country. The main objective of the website is to raise awareness about the Cuban Five and work for their freedom.</p>

                    <p>After the trial, "The Committee to Secure Justice in the Rosenberg Case" was formed. This committee was led by David and Emily Alman. After the executions, the same committee became "The Committee to Secure Justice for Morton Sobell", a codefendant with the Rosenbergs. Sobell was also convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage and was sentenced to 30 years in jail. Approximately ten years later, the National Committee to Reopen the Rosenberg Case (NCRRC) was formed and has continuously been in existence ever since. Aaron Katz, a member of the original committee, served as director for 42 years, until his retirement in 2005. The current co-directors are Leonard Lehrman and Richard Corey. The Committee seeks to have the Rosenbergs and Sobell exonerated and to have the government publicly address and own up to its complicity in the terrible miscarriage of justice that took place in this case. The NCRRC also supports campaigns to redress the unjust incarceration and excessive punishment of prisoners; including the imposition of the death penalty on Mumia Abu-Jamal. The NCRRC deplores the dismal failure of our judicial system and calls for its review and reform.</p>

                    <p>The National Security Archive announces (8/25/2009) the publication of the Torture Archive -- more than 83,000 pages of primary source documents (and thousands more to come) related to the detention and interrogation of individuals by the United States, in connection with the conduct of hostilities in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as in the broader context of the "global war on terror." The goal of the Torture Archive is to become the online institutional memory for essential evidence on torture in U.S. policy. Many of these documents are available in multiple locations on the Internet and in numerous private collections, thanks to landmark Freedom of Information Act and habeas litigation, leaks from whistleblowers, public relations releases from government, investigative reporting by journalists including the Torturing Democracy team, and Congressional investigations. But the disparate locations, enormous volume of documents, and lack of indexing or standard cataloging have presented real difficulties for users. With support from the Open Society Institute and the JEHT Foundation since 2006, the National Security Archive has undertaken to bring together all these materials in digital formats, organize and catalog them for maximum utility and access, and publish them online in multiple packages including a comprehensive searchable database. By combining released executive branch policy memoranda, legal documents from U.S. and foreign courts, and on-the-ground information about actual practices by the U.S. military and intelligence personnel, the Torture Archive presents a comprehensive view of the war on terrorism, its foundations and its implications. This initial launch of the Torture Archive includes the complete set of declassified Combatant Status Review Tribunal and Administrative Review Board files from the Pentagon, and thousands of documents resulting from FOIA litigation brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, the Archive and other plaintiffs. The Torture Archive will continue to add documents as they are released through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) litigation or Executive discretion.</p>

                    <p>The North-Atlantic Left Dialogue, an initiative of the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation, is an attempt to develop a continuous working relationship between left and socialist intellectuals and academics in Europe (starting with Germans and Italians) and North America (USA/Canada) for the purpose of discussing the distinctive challenges to the political, social and cultural left working and struggling in the highly developed northern capitalist countries. They hope to contribute to the internationalization of the left and in the process establish a framework for thinking about reform demands which are feasible and appropriate for countries at a comparable stage of development. The website contains information and blog posts on their seminars.</p>

                    <p>Northland Poster Collective closed at the end of June, 2009. For thirty years it was an activist art organization and business devoted to using art in support of organizing, education and movement building. This site tells some of the story of Northland's years in narratives, testimonials and photos. There are also links to the ongoing projects that started under Northland's wing and are continuing to provide some of the services that Northland offered. There is even an opportunity for our friends, allies and others to post your own comments about Northland, its history and your connections to or observations of its presence among the struggles for social justice in our time. We are pleased to announce the opening of Northland artist Ricardo Levins Morales' new studio web site. The site features his posters and note cards which are available for purchase.</p>

The organization raises funds for Manning, posts news about Manning and on other cases related to government surveillance and whistle-blowing, as well as a campaign to pardon Manning. The website also contains a significant amount of information on the trial that took place in 2013.</p>

The organization worked to release the prisoners, eleven of which were offered clemency in 1999 by President Bill Clinton. As of 2013, one prisoner, Oscar López Rivera, remains in prisoner. The website was defunct by late 2011, at that point two other prisoners, Avelino Gonzalez Claudio, and Norberto Gonzalez Claudio, also remained in prison. It contains writings by the prisoners, a radio show, newsletters, video, and a history of the organization and cases.</p>

                    <p>Redstockings was a name taken in 1969 by one of the founding women's liberation groups of the 1960's to represent the union of two traditions: the "bluestocking" label disparagingly pinned on feminists of earlier centuries--and "red" for revolution. Redstockings today is a grassroots, activist "think tank", for defending and advancing the women's liberation agenda. The Archives for Action is a project Redstockings established in 1989 to make the experiences of the 1960’s movement more widely available for new understandings and improved strategies. The movement also supports a national health care system and equal job benefits for women.</p>

The findings have been quite revealing, showing that what’s found in the data is often the best divulger of the truth. The reports have been introduced into the Congressional record by the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee, the House Armed Services Committee, and as part of a Resolution by the European Parliament.</p>

                    <p>Socialism and Democracy Online is the journal of the Research Group on Socialism and Democracy. Socialism and Democracy publishes scholarly articles on socialist politics and vision. The perspective is broadly Marxist, encouraging not only critique of the status quo, but also informed analysis of the different approaches to bringing about fundamental change, and seeking to integrate issues of race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity and nationality with the traditional focus on class. Articles reflect many disciplines and their authors include activists, independent scholars, and poets, as well as academics. The website contains featured articles, articles from the current issue, back issues, and links.</p>

                    <p>The Socialist Labor Party (SLP) is the original party of socialism in America. Organized as the Workingmen's Party in 1876, the Party was renamed in 1877.Its longtime leader was Daniel De Leon (1852-1914), Marxist author and editor of The People, the SLP newspaper. As the only nationally organized party of socialism in America until 1900, the SLP attracted Socialists of all tendencies to its ranks. However, the Marxist element became dominant by 1890, when the Party was reorganized on a Marxist basis. The SLP has played a prominent role in the economic and political life of the United States. It ran the first socialist presidential campaign in 1892, and fielded national tickets in every presidential campaign through 1976. The SLP's goal is a classless society based on collective ownership and control of the industries and social services, these to be administered in the interests of all society through a Socialist Industrial Union government composed of democratically elected representatives from all the industries and services of the land. Production would be carried on for use instead of profit. The SLP program for achieving this revolutionary change from capitalism to socialism is based on the Marxist tenet that socialism can be achieved only through the classconscious action "of the working class itself." The Socialist Industrial Union program, as the SLP program is known, developed by Daniel De Leon (1852-1914), is a continuation of Karl Marx's ideas on a workers' government. In all essentials--political and economic classwide organization, the breakup of the state, workers' democracy, the seizure of social power by the organized producers and their socialist reorganization of the economy--the SIU program of the SLP conforms to the democratic premises underlying Marx's concept of socialism.</p>

The SSSP has twenty-two special problems divisions, each with its own newsletter, that provide members with common interests the opportunity to interact more intimately with one another. The SSSP promotes dialogue through presentations at the annual meeting, and through listservs and newsletters throughout the year; publishes research in the journal Social Problems; presents awards to community groups; supports graduate students, young scholars and activists with professional support, leadership opportunities, and scholarships; passes and acts upon public resolutions; and fosters the generation of new ideas.

                    <p>Soh Daiko, founded in New York City in 1979, was the first group in the Northeastern United States. Taiko, a kind of traditional Japanese drumming used for ritual celebrations and festivals also became a contemporary performing art of mass drumming in the 1960s. Soh Daiko’s performances blend movement and choreography with music; its repertoire includes traditional compositions from Shinto music tradition, adapting existing taiko compositions and performing original arrangements by its own members. The group has participated in local New York City cultural festivities, it has performed across the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, and has been featured in segments on public radio and television. The website contains event listings, videos of their performances, images, and information about recruitment.</p>

                    <p>The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives at New York University form a unique, internationally-known center for scholarly research on Labor and the Left. The primary focus is the complex relationship between trade unionism and progressive politics and how this evolved over time. Archival, print, photograph, film, and oral history collections describe the history of the labor movement and how it related to the broader struggle for economic, social, and political change. In 1977 the Robert F. Wagner Archives was established as a joint program of the New York City Central Labor Council and the Tamiment Library. The Wagner is the designated repository for the records of the Council's more than 200 member unions. Today the Library has an extraordinary research collection documenting the history of organized labor in New York and the workers who built the City. Tamiment has one of the finest research collections in the country documenting the history of radical politics: socialism, communism, anarchism, utopian experiments, the cultural left, the New Left, and the struggle for civil rights and civil liberties. It is the repository for the Archives of Irish America, the Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives, and a growing Asian American labor collection.</p>

                    <p>DS4SI (Design Studio for Social Intervention) is dedicated to changing how social justice is imagined, developed and deployed here in the United States. We are creating a design studio for the progressive arm of the nonprofit sector in order to support the sector’s ability to create new forms of effective social intervention and the exploration of new ways to be interventionists. We believe that creating a space for design and intentionally supporting the development of a sector-specific design practice is imperative in order for the sector to break out of its box of exhausted forms. In so doing, we will liberate our vision, invigorate our spirit and be able to take the greatest possible advantage of this moment.</p>

                    <p>The Feminist Theory Website provides research materials and information for students, activists, and scholars interested in women's conditions and struggles around the world. The goals of this website are: 1) to encourage a wide range of research into feminist theory, and 2) to encourage dialogue between women (and men) from different countries around the world. Hopefully, this will result in new connections, new ideas, and new information about feminist theory and women's movements. The Feminist Theory Website has three parts: 1) various fields within feminist theory; 2) different national / ethnic feminisms; and 3) individual feminists. All of these parts are updated and expanded regularly. To access these pages, please click on the buttons in the left column.</p>

                    <p>This website is an archive dedicated to the Trials of the Scottsboro Boys, which was a set of trials, convictions, reversals, and retrials of an alleged gang rape of two white girls by nine black teenagers on a Southern Railroad freight run on March 25, 1931. The results of the trial opened southern juries to blacks, exacerbated sectional strife, and divided America's political left.</p>

                    <p>The Yes Men are a radical culture jamming activist duo and network of supporters created by Andy Bichlbaum and Mike Bonanno. To date, the duo has produced two films: The Yes Men (2003) and The Yes Men Fix the World (2009). In these films, they impersonate and ridicule corporate criminals and others, a practice that they call "identity correction". They create and maintain fake websites similar to ones they intend to spoof. They espouse the belief that corporations and governmental organizations act in dehumanizing ways toward the public.</p>

                    <p>The Trayvon Martin Organizing Committee is an organization that advocates for justice for Trayvon Martin. Martin was fatally shot by George Zimmerman on February 26, 2012. Zimmerman was tried on June 24, 2013, and found not guilty the following day. The organization believes that Martin’s death was a race based murder and Zimmerman was not arrested because of white supremacy and classism inherent in the criminal justice system. The website contains information about rallies in response to the not guilty verdict, as well as reports from the rallies’ aftermath.</p>

The goal of the gathering was to build unity around common goals of social justice, to build ties between organizations present at the event, and to help build a broader social justice movement.</p>

                    <p>William Kunstler (July 7, 1919 – September 4, 1995) was a prominent civil rights and civil liberties lawyer and civil rights activist, among whose notable clients were the Chicago 8, the American Indian Movement, and the prisoners at Attica Prison (New York State). Kunstler was a board member of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the co-founder of the Law Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR). The William Moses Kunstler Fund for Racial Justice supports the WMK Racial Justice Fellow at the Center for Constitutional Rights, makes grants, and helps to coordinate and implement projects and initiatives in the interest of racial justice. For the past five years, the Fund has helped organize vigils of families affected by the Rockefeller Drug Laws in New York City and throughout the state and has helped mobilize families and publicize the harsh sentencing and racially biased enforcement of drug legislation throughout the United States.</p>

                    <p>At our inception, with the December 5-17, 2005: Walk to Guantanamo to Visit the Prisoners, Witness Against Torture was a group of friends who-- as Americans and Catholics-- walked to Guantanamo to visit the prisoners, to perform a work of mercy, to respond to the victims of the war on terrorism. Once we returned from that journey, we began to organize more broadly to shut down Guantanamo, working with interfaith, human rights and activists' organizations. We have planned a series of nonviolent direct actions to expose and decry the administration's lawlessness, build awareness about torture and indefinite detention amongst Americans and forge human ties with the prisoners at Guantanamo and their families.</p>

                    <p>Working Class Vegan is a website that presents an abolitionist approach to animal rights theory which maintains that all sentient beings, humans or nonhumans, have one right: the basic right not to be treated as the property of others, in a clear and consistent manner to the working class, and makes veganism accessible to all, especially low-income households and underprivileged neighborhoods. WCV supports only those campaigns and positions that explicitly promote the abolitionist agenda, and rejects sexism, racism, heterosexism or other forms of discrimination against humans.</p>
