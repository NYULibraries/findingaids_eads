            <abstract id="ref6" label="Abstract">Jeffrey Ballinger is a human rights and labor rights activist, writer, and educator. He was the founder and director of Press for Change, a human rights organization focusing on the rights of workers in the developing world, and the founder of No Sweat, a wholesale distributor of American, union-made apparel. The collection consists of correspondence between Ballinger and other writers and activists interested in human and labor rights, newspaper and magazine clippings, and VHS cassettes. The main topics are Nike (the corporation, its labor practices, its co-founder and former CEO Philip Knight, and its endorsements of sports figures), human rights, labor rights, and labor issues in the developing world (especially Indonesia). The materials date from 1992-2001, with the bulk being between 1995-1998.</abstract>

            <head>Audiovisual Access Policies and Procedures</head>
            <p>Researchers interested in using audiovisual materials in this collection (films, cassette tapes, VHS tapes, et cetera) must use a digitized copy, which we refer to as an access copy. Researchers may view an item’s original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that have already been digitized are noted in the collection’s finding aid and can be requested in our reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@nyu.edu with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested. A librarian will respond to you with further information.</p>

            <head>Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Jeffrey Ballinger is a human rights and labor rights activist, writer, and educator. While working for the AFL-CIO’s Asian-American Free Labor Institute in Indonesia directing trade union training programs, he came into contact with workers at Nike contractor factories and was appalled by the working conditions there. He founded Press for Change in 1993 to focus on Nike’s labor practices in Indonesia.</p>

            <head>Appraisal note</head>
            <p>The collection originally consisted of 4 record cartons of mainly secondary source material, mostly clippings from common newspapers and journals, with some full-text journals, books, and reports. As all of the newspapers, journals, books, and reports are available through the general collection of the Libraries of New York University, these items were removed.</p>

            <head>Scope and Contents note</head>
            <p>Collection contains correspondence on proposed articles by Ballinger, with organizations with which he was associated (mainly those in assistance of Indonesian workers and student organizations against university endorsements of Nike), correspondence and a VHS cassette on a Nike sneaker give-back campaign by settlement houses across New York City, and letters to the editor by Ballinger; published and unpublished writings by Ballinger and others; Press for Change press releases, reports, correspondence, newsletter (Nike in Indonesia), and a VHS cassette with a report by Ballinger on sweatshops; Ballinger’s research materials, mainly Nike documents regarding Indonesian factories and publicity, including press releases, internal correspondence and memoranda, a transcript of a shareholders meeting, and a VHS cassette with news reports on Nike protests; and correspondence, clippings, and summaries of meetings regarding conferences at which Ballinger participated or attended. The collection reflects Ballinger’s work as an individual and through Press for Change. Dates of the collection are 1992-2001, with the bulk between 1995-1998.</p>
