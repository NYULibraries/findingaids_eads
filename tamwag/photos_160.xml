            <p>Ed Roth was a member of District 65, United Retail and Wholesale Employees of America (which later affiliated with and separated from a number of larger labor unions, culminating with its affiliating with the United Automobile Workers of America (UAW)). In 1940, he joined District 65's Camera Club, which originated in 1938 as a recreational group for the union's amateur photographers. Since participants in the club often attended and photographed strikes and other union events, many Camera Club members came to serve as staff photographers for the union's newspaper,

            <p>Roth became president of the Camera Club in 1941 and served until around 1948, but was most active with the club during World War II. He also worked as a photographer outside of his association with District 65. After leaving District 65, Roth worked in the construction industry. He was part of the crew that worked on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which was built between 1959 and 1964, and took photographs of the bridge as it was being constructed.</p>
