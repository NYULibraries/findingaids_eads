            <p>This collection contains material created or collected by Virginia Cornue relating to her education, activism, and research. Materials from Cornue's doctoral candidacy at Rutgers University completed in 2001 include correspondence, administrative records, grant applications, syllabi, student assignments, conference papers and addresses, and drafts of Cornue's dissertation, “Sex, Love, and Tenderness: Chinese Urban Women in the Great Global Market” in both paper and electronic format. The majority of the material is related to Cornue's research into women's health in China, Hong Kong, and Macau in the mid-1990s, including Chinese and English-language documents addressing technology, modernity, freedom of the press, clothing, political activism, economics, Western investment, and gay rights. The collection also includes material related to Cornue's involvement in a number of New York and New Jersey women's organizations between 1978 and 1990, including the National Organization of Women in New York City (NOW-NYC), The Women's Funding Coalition-NYC, Newark Emergency Services for Families, National Youth Employment Project, and Girls Clubs of America. These materials include flags, banners, protest signs, posters, buttons, newspapers, correspondence, and memoranda related to women's rights campaigns and demonstrations between the 1970s and 1990s; the attempt to pass the Equal Rights Amendment; responses from the "Potty Talk" campaign at Douglass University; and items and various workshops given by Cornue between the 1970s and early 2000s.</p>
