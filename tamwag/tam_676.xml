            <p>Jessie Taft Smith (1914- ) is an activist and organizer based in New York City. She was a member of the Communist Party of the United States' (CPUSA) pioneer movement, and during her youth she helped organize in laundries and participated in garment strikes. Smith worked at Harlem Hospital for about ten years until 1977; was a long-standing member of District Council 37; and is heavily involved in tenant, community, and civil rights organizing. She has been particularly involved in the Park Terrace Tenants Association and the MA-RK (Marble Hill, Riverdale, Kingsbridge) Committee for Civil Rights.</p>

            <p>At the request of Jane La Tour, two collections of materials concerning Morris Eli Taft, Jessie Taft Smith's father, were deaccessioned from the Kheel Center for Labor-Management Documentation and Archives at Cornell University in June of 2015 and constituted the family papers that were included with the donation to the Tamiment Library. The collections had been identified at the Kheel Center as the Morris Eli Taft Papers (#5178m) and the Morris Eli Taft Memorabilia (#5178 MB).</p>

            <head>Audiovisual Access Policies and Procedures</head>
            <p>Researchers interested in using audiovisual materials in this collection (films, cassette tapes, VHS tapes, et cetera) must use a digitized copy, which we refer to as an access copy. Researchers may view an item’s original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that already have already been digitized are noted in the collection’s finding aid and can be requested in our reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@nyu.edu with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested. A librarian will respond to you with further information.</p>
