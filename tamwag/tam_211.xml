                <emph render="italic">Radical History Review</emph>, most working manuscripts and correspondence regarding edits to articles were removed from the collection. Routine financial information, including most tax forms and requests for reimbursement, were also removed, though important summary documents like budgets were retained.</p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>The Mid-Atlantic Radical Historians Organization (MARHO) was formed during a conference at Fordham University in January 1973, attended mostly by professors at colleges and universities in the metropolitan New York area. The members of the conference who formed MARHO sought to foster communication among radical historians through the creation of a membership directory, the sponsorship of additional conferences, and the establishment of a newsletter containing "discussions of subjects of mutual concern and announcements of activities in the region." MARHO's quarterly newsletter was the beginning of the 
                <emph render="italic">Radical History Review</emph>, which is currently published by Duke University Press. The journal seeks to "address issues of gender, race, sexuality, imperialism, and class" and stretch "the boundaries of historical analysis to explore Western and non-Western histories." In addition to articles on the theme of any given issue, the journal is often comprised of sections dedicated to teaching and public history, as well as reviews of television, books, museum exhibitions, and other media.</p>
