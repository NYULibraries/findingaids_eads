      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>In January 1937, Robert Steck, actor and social activist, sailed to Europe to volunteer for
        the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil War. In the following months, Steck served
        in the International Brigades with the First Regiment de Tren, where he was elected
        political commissar; worked with British writer Ralph Bates, putting out the magazine
        Volunteer for Liberty; headed the Tarazona Base Cultural Commission, adapting his theater
        experience to the political and social realities of the war and creating skits performed off
        the back of trucks (known as "Buffoons on Trucks"); and was rifleman, runner and battalion
        scout for the Third Lincoln company.On April 9, 1938, during the retreat from Gandesa, Steck
        was captured by Italian fascists, who would have executed him were it not for Mussolini's
        order to exchange International Brigaders for captured fascists. Steck was first kept for
        two days in complete darkness at the bottom of a cistern, then transferred to the prison at
        San Pedro de Cardena, where he spent the following seventeen months. While in prison Steck
        organized an "Institute for Higher Learning" and, together with fellow-prisoners Hy Wallach
        and Sidney Rosenblatt, put out a handwritten newspaper, "Jaily News," illustrated by British
        prisoner Jimmy Moon. They made only a single copy of each issue, concealing it beneath the
        floorboards when it wasn't being surreptitiously circulated among the prisoners (Steck later
        smuggled two issues home under his clothes). It was only after the war had ended that the
        State Department finally negotiated the release of a group of eleven prisoners that included
        Steck. </p>
      <p>After returning to the States he quickly connected with the recently-formed Veterans of the
        Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB), chairing the Committee for the Release of the International
        Prisoners in Spain. After serving in World War II, Steck became a history teacher. Steck
        remained a core member of VALB, serving twice on the Executive Board of the National
        Council, and chairing the Prisoner Historical Committee. From 1979 through 1986, he worked
        closely with veteran Carl Geiser on Geiser's book <emph render="italic">Prisoners of the
          Good Fight</emph> (Lawrence Hill and Co., 1986), organizing fundraising endeavors,
        conducting research -- including taped interviews, and traveling internationally to locate
        American ex-prisoners. </p>
