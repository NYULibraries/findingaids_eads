        Collection represents the core motion picture film collection of the Tamiment Library and
        Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives. It includes the film archives of the Transport Workers
        Union of America, a labor union founded in 1934 to organize subway workers and bus drivers
        in the New York City area that later included taxi drivers, railway employees, airline
        workers and utility workers in locals across the country; films and film footage from
        District 65/UAW , another labor union formed in New York City (in 1933) that organized
        warehouse workers, later expanding to include workers from the retail and manufacturing
        sectors, clerical personnel, salesclerks, writers, editors, technicians, and lawyers,
        include large numbers of women; a complete film, <title render="italic">Nos Maisons
          d’Enfants</title>, from the Jewish Labor Committee, a New York-based umbrella group of
        Jewish or Jewish-led trade unions and fraternal organizations, founded in 1934 to organize
        anti-Nazi and anti-fascist activity and to provide assistance to European Jews and others
        persecuted by these movements; footage shot by still photographer John Albok (1894-1982),
        known for his images of children and New York City street life during the Depression, who
        also documented organized labor and left-radical political life in New York City; and early
        footage of Camp Tamiment, a summer resort for socialists, in the Pocono Mountains of
        Pennsylvania, that opened in 1921. The remainder of the materials in the Collection come
        from various other labor and radical organizations. Together, they comprise approximately 40
        hours of black and white and color 16mm motion picture film (and one 35mm film) which have
        been transferred to video for research use. They document activities and history of the
        labor movement and radical left or progressive organizations, mostly in New York City
        (although Philadelphia, Barcelona, Geneva, and a few locations in France are also
        represented. Most were produced by or for labor, left or progressive organizations and
        associated individuals in the United States. The Collection includes a dozen documentary
        films and a similar number each of television programs and filmed press conferences, but the
        largest proportion of materials by far consists of outtakes and edited sequences from these
        productions; a small amount of stock footage shot, acquired for, or associated with, these
        productions and unedited footage not associated with them.</abstract>

      <p>Researchers interested in using audiovisual materials in this collection (films, cassette
        tapes, VHS tapes, et cetera) must use a digitized copy, which we refer to as an access copy.
        Researchers may view an item’s original container, but the media themselves are not
        available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that already have already
        been digitized are noted in the collection’s finding aid and can be requested in our reading
        room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be
        used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The
        process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy, or if you are unsure
        if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@nyu.edu with the collection
        name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested. A librarian will
        respond to you with further information.</p>

      <p>The Tamiment/Wagner Moving Images Collection represents the core motion picture film
        collection of the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives at New York
        University. A description of the four main creators/subject areas of footage follows.</p>
      <p>The Transport Workers Union of America (TWU) was founded in New York City in 1934 by subway
        workers. Affiliating with the fledgling CIO, it soon became the bargaining agent for all New
        York City bus and subway systems, and branched out to form locals across the country. By the
        early 1950s the union's membership had grown to over 100,000, in both public and
        privately-owned transit lines. By the 1960s, TWU locals were also established among
        railroad, airlines, and utility workers and taxi drivers. Politically progressive, it
        actively supported equal rights for African-Americans long before the civil rights movement
        of the 1960s. Its principal and eventually successful struggle in the decade or so following
        World War II was to win a five-day, forty-hour week for its members. Its New York Local 100
        has always been the largest and most influential in the union.</p>
      <p>The TWU’s founders were mostly Irish immigrants who came to the United States after the
        Irish rebellion of 1916. Among them was Michael J. Quill (1905-1966), a Kerry native and
        subway ticket clerk who led early organizing efforts for the TWU, and became its president,
        a position he held for the first thirty years of the union’s existence. Quill's leadership
        abilities and public persona quickly spread his influence beyond his own union to make him a
        key player in the broader labor and political arenas in New York and nationally. He was
        elected to two terms on New York’s City Council, on the American Labor Party ticket, was the
        chairman of the City’s CIO Council, and later served as a vice president on the AFL-CIO's
        executive council.</p>
      <p>From its early days the TWU made aggressive use of public relations to communicate with its
        members as well as the general public, and to keep its fingers on the pulse of public
        opinion: it tape-recorded important meetings, it produced hundreds of radio advertisements
        for itself and its political allies, as well as live radio broadcasts. And it used moving
        images as well. It filmed union soapbox speakers and rallies and Michael Quill's election
        campaign rallies in the 1930; it documented TWU field days and victory rallies during World
        War II. In 1941 the union produced its first film documentary, the half-hour, <title
          render="italic">United We Are Invincible</title>(aka <title render="italic">United We
          Strike</title>, aka <title render="italic">The Great Bus Strike of 1941</title>), which
        told the story of the union's strike against New York City bus lines. This was followed by
        several other documentaries commissioned by the union. The TWU also enthusiastically
        embraced the new medium of television in early 1951, when it launched what was to be the
        first of hundreds of television programs and filmed press releases produced by the union (a
        small selection is included in this Collection). Most of these were made by professional
        filmmakers and producers, including Paul Miner, Tom Costigan, and Workers Film and
        Photograph League member, Leo Seltzer.</p>
      <p>The labor union later known as District 65, UAW, was organized in New York City in 1933 by
        Arthur Osman. In 1938 it became Local 65 of the United Retail and Wholesale Employees of
        America, CIO. Though at first composed primarily of male, Jewish warehouse workers, the
        union expanded to include members of varied ethnic backgrounds from the retail and
        manufacturing sectors, clerical personnel, salesclerks, writers, editors, technicians, and
        lawyers, and it came to include large numbers of women. The union was characterized by
        democratic, rank and file rule, and an activist progressive political agenda that included
        early and active support for the civil rights movement.</p>
      <p>The Jewish Labor Committee, an umbrella group of Jewish or Jewish-led trade unions and
        fraternal organizations, was founded in New York City in 1934. Its primary purposes were to
        organize anti-Nazi and anti-fascist activity and to provide assistance to European Jews and
        others persecuted by these movements. During World War II it maintained close ties with
        European resistance movements and was able to effect the rescue of hundreds of labor and
        socialist activists and their families. After the War, it assisted and resettled survivors
        and helped to reunite families, and became active in civil rights and labor rights campaigns
        in the United States and human rights work world wide.</p>
      <p>John Albok (1894-1982), who immigrated to the United States from Hungary in 1921, and
        opened a tailor shop to support himself and his family, was also a still photographer known
        for his sensitive depiction of Central Park, children, and New York City street life from
        the Depression through the 1960s; he also photographed images of trade-union and leftwing
        political protest and culture during this same period. He occasionally documented the same
        subjects in moving images, using 16mm black and white and color film.</p>
      <p>Camp Tamiment, a summer resort for socialists, their families and friends, near Bushkill,
        Pennsylvania, opened in 1921. Its initial purpose was to serve as a summer retreat for
        faculty, students, and friends of the Rand School of Social Science (a school for workers in
        New York City that was closely allied with the Socialist Party) and to provide a reliable
        source of revenue to support the School. The Camp was also home to the Tamiment Playhouse, a
        major creative outlet for theater, dance, film, and television in the United States,
        nurturing major entertainment figures such as Max Liebman, Jerome Robbins and Danny Kaye.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The Collection is comprised of approximately 40 hours of motion picture film, comprising
        193 separate segments that document the activities and history of the labor movement and
        left or progressive organizations, mostly in New York City (although Philadelphia,
        Barcelona, Geneva, and a few locations in France are also represented/depicted/included). It
        consists, with a single exception, entirely of 16mm film—primarily in black and white, but
        with a significant amount in color--and of the 51 videotapes to which these film materials
        were transferred, to create surrogates to allow screening while protecting the originals.
        Almost all of the materials in the collection were produced by and/or for labor, left, or
        progressive organizations or associated individuals in the United States. About a dozen
        documentary films, a similar number of television programs (kinescopes), and a dozen and a
        half filmed press conferences form the core of the Collection, but a larger proportion
        consists of outtakes and edited sequences from these productions, as well as a unedited
        footage and a small amount of stock footage shot, acquired for, or associated with, these
        productions.</p>

      <p>The largest share of the materials in the Collection (84% --168 of the 193 segments) is the
        film archive of the Transport Workers Union of America (TWU) -- a national, New York
        City-based labor union whose members are mainly bus and subway workers. The TWU materials
        stretch from the 1930s through 1967 and document the union's own activities as well as of
        some of its friends and allies, including mass meetings, conventions, speeches, negotiation
        sessions, picket lines, demonstrations, parades and press conferences. It is also notable in
        illustrating the TWU's pioneering embrace of television as a public relations tool for trade
        unions. The remainder of the Collection--the non-TWU footage—while it represents a much
        smaller amount, is more eclectic and international in scope. It includes footage ranging
        from the 1920s through the 1960s documenting organizations or individuals associated with
        the three main strands of left-radical politics and culture: Communism, Socialism, and
        anarchism, as well as footage of, or produced by, other labor organizations, both U.S. and
        foreign. Also represented are New York City May Day parades in color and black and white,
        New York City and state politicians, and the daily life of poor, homeless, and working-class
        children and adults in New York City during the depths of the Depression, as well as such
        occasional random surprises as a shot of the dirigible Hindenberg flying above Madison
        Avenue on the day it later crashed and burned.</p>

      <p>While the footage in this Collection documents events and activities specific to labor
        history and radical and progressive movements, it also documents topics unrelated to these.
        A wide range of activities, locations, occupations, subjects, attitudes and emotions was
        incidentally captured, in addition to the intended themes. For example, the same footage
        that documents union activities in New York City in the 1930s shows street scenes in
        working-class neighborhoods in Manhattan and other boroughs that are seldom seen in moving
        images; while picket lines snake around the block and soap-boxers inveigh, in the background
        and foreground everyday life goes on; in front of tenements and brownstone stoops, children
        frolic and parents push baby carriages, and a horse-drawn cart and a bicycles ride through
        the frame (in some of these scenes exact locations are even thoughtfully provided—because
        the addresses appear on the signs carried by union members picketing in front of the homes
        of more than a dozen individual TWU members who have "deserted" the union). Similarly, a
        panoply of the feet and shoes (only) of ordinary New Yorkers on Fifth Avenue can be seen as
        part of a sequence whose purpose was to illustrate the effectiveness of a 1950s transit
        strike by showing the public walking instead of riding public transport. These
        unintentionally-recorded, usually fragmentary, documents of social history can be of
        particular value because they are candid and unposed, in contrast to the staged official
        activities which were shot to document and promote the activities of the organizations that
        commissioned them. Other "unintended documents" in the Collection include footage of public
        meeting places such as hotels and auditoriums; office, restaurant, and workplace interiors;
        mass transit, including subway trains and buses, subway and bus passengers, train stations
        and an airport; power plants and industrial equipment; the deserted waterfront of a New
        Jersey port; the changing streetscapes and neighborhoods of New York City, as well as some
        of its landmarks (the interior of the old Pennsylvania Railroad Station and its clock, New
        York Public Library, and St. Patrick's Cathedral, Coney Island's Cyclone rollercoaster, and
        facades of businesses such as a Horn and Hardart Automat, and the Peck and Peck women's
        clothing store); track and field events, team sports recreation and resorts; parades and
        marching bands; voting; social dancing; stenographers, shoe shiners, television camera
        operators, reporters, police, waiters, musicians and teachers at work. Also:
        racially-integrated social and organizational gatherings in the 1930s, 40s, and 50s;
        rhetorical styles and oratory of politicians and union leaders; demeanor and dress of
        ordinary middle-class and working-class Americans in the mid-twentieth century; and
        performance styles on early public affairs television programs.</p>

      <p>Each film segment described in the container list below has been assigned a unique Tape #
        and Tape Hour # (T# and H#). These T# / H#'s can be found in the container list. All segment
        titles have been supplied by archives staff except those in italics, which are the original
        titles given by the film's creator(s). Please note that running times for segments are
        approximate only, not exact. The container list consists of brief descriptions of each
        segment that includes a title, the location where the segment was shot, whether it is black
        and white or color, whether it has sound or is silent, footage type (these include complete
        film, part of film, filmed press releases, and "footage," by which is meant edited
        sequences, outtakes or unedited footage -- or combinations of these), date and approximate
        total running time; it can be used to browse the entire contents of the Collection. For more
        information on any individual segment, more detailed descriptions are available, including
        shot-by-shot descriptions of the contents with "in and out points" for each shot (e.g.,
        showing approximately where a shot in the segment begins and ends), and for whom or what
        entity the segment was produced. The detailed descriptions can be reached by clicking on the

      <p>Most notably, they include many hours of footage of the TWU's ebullient, truculent,
        theatrical and colorful long-time president, Michael J. Quill. These present a visual record
        of his life and career, from young and sprightly in the 1930s (including a rally during his
        successful 1939 campaign to be elected to the New York City Council) to aging and ill, being
        jailed during the disastrous 1966 New York City transit strike, and, only weeks later, his
        funeral cortege emerging from New York City's St. Patrick's Cathedral, and including
        glimpses of his family, his son, John Quill, as well as his wives, Mollie (O’Neill) Quill
        and Shirley (Garry) Quill. Quill's fiery oratory, sharp tongue, shrewd wit, and agile
        repartee is on display here, including his trademark threat, that the union would stay on
        the picket line "until the plains of hell itself freeze over"; his calling one of New York
        City's mayors "a plain, ordinary, common liar"; and many instances of his rhetorically
        skewering his opponents (in management, in politics, and within his own union) in person and
        in the media. The series also includes other TWU officers and staff, including: Eugene
        Attreed, Gustav Faber, Maurice Forge, Daniel Gilmartin, William Grogan, Matthew Guinan,
        Austin Hogan, James Horst, Andrew Kaelin, Mark Kavanaugh, Matthew Kearns, Douglas MacMahon,
        Frank O'Connor, John O'Donnell, Harry Sacher, John Santo, James Shannon, Frank Sheehan, and
        Ellis Van Riper.</p>

      <p>TWU footage also includes prominent leaders of other unions and national labor
        organizations, such as the CIO's John L. Lewis, Philip Murray and Allan Haywood, the
        AFL-CIO's George Meany, Joseph Curran of the National Maritime Union, David J. MacDonald of
        the United Steel Workers, and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters' James R. Hoffa
        (who can be seen promising not to raid TWU locals); officials of New York City and State
        AFL-CIO councils, including Raymond Diana, Louis Hollander, Morris Iushewitz, Martin Lacey,
        and Harry Van Arsdale, Jr. Other labor-related figures represented include Arthur Goldberg,
        a labor lawyer whose clients included the TWU before he became United States Secretary of
        Labor and later a United States Supreme Court Justice; noted labor arbitrator, Theodore
        Kheel; labor negotiator, Julius Manson and "labor priest," Father Charles Owen Rice of
        Pittsburgh. Politicians and officials are represented, too: New York City mayors Fiorello
        LaGuardia and Robert F. Wagner, Jr.; New York City Transit Authority commissioners John J.
        Gilhooley and Joseph E. O' Grady, and Philadelphia mayors Joseph S. Clark, Jr., Richardson
        Dilworth, and James Hugh Joseph Tate. Also worth noting are persons who are not on-screen,
        but are mentioned, usually with invective. Rudolph Halley, president of the New York City
        Council, New York City mayor Vincent Impellitteri, New York City Comptroller Lawrence E.
        Gerosa, New York State governor Thomas E. Dewey, and anti-union, anti-communist lawyer Roy
        Cohn, all get their share of this treatment.</p>

      <p>Other footage includes mass meetings, rallies, demonstrations, Labor Day parades (which
        document other unions' contingents as well as the TWU's), contract negotiations, press
        conferences, picket lines, strikes, and speeches, beginning with the early days of the TWU
        in the 1930s and 1940s (including its attendance at a 1943 national CIO convention); TWU
        participation in World War II "United Front" activities such as a huge 1942 "Defend America"
        rally, with US and Soviet flags side by side on the podium and buses bearing slogans like,
        "Uncle Sam Won't Miss the Bus—Lick Hitler in 1942; and the expulsion of Communist Party
        members from the union six years later. Also shown are members at work: bus drivers, subway
        conductors and motormen, utility workers, baggage handlers and airplane maintenance
        mechanics, flight attendants, railroad train maintenance workers, and gas utility workers.
        The ethnic makeup of TWU's officers and members, many of them of Irish extraction, is
        reflected in footage of TWU officers and members participating in New York City's annual St.
        Patrick's Day parade; footage of members and officers of other ethnic groups, including
        African-American officers such as Herman C. Gray, Louis Manning, Edward T. Williamson, and
        rank and file members in the audience at mass meetings.</p>

      <p>Also among these materials are: a long speech given by Michael Quill at the union's 30th
        anniversary meeting in 1964, in which he discusses the TWU's and his relationship with the
        Communist Party, as well as what may be the earliest footage of an attempted corporate
        takeover and proxy fight, as Quill and the TWU went toe-to-toe over the management of the
        Fifth Avenue Bus Company – represented by Lawrence Weissman, Harry Weinberg, and Roy Cohn --
        in 1962. (This sequence includes candid footage in which some participants are clearly not
        aware of being filmed.) And while there is no footage directly showing dissidents against
        the TWU's entrenched leadership, documentation of these groups and individuals is not
        entirely absent. It is manifested in Quill's shouting down union dissidents from the podium,
        in his direct as well as oblique (uncomplimentary) references to them at mass meetings, and
        in his testy response to questions from reporters about wildcat strikes within the union;
        and it can be heard in occasional catcalls from the TWU convention floor.</p>

      <p>The series also includes informal and candid scenes of working-class social life of the
        1940s and 50s, for example, color footage of union officers and members with spouses and
        children, dressed in their Sunday best, attending an annual "Field Day" in Croke Park in the
        Bronx; the union's "11th annual outing," replete with drum and bagpipe bands, pony rides,
        clowns, hotdogs, beer, ice cream, and competitive athletic events such as softball, soccer,
        high jump, horse shoes, shot put, foot races; footage of a racially integrated holiday party
        showing adults smoking and drinking; and an unbuttoned banquet celebration including a
        stripper.</p>

      <p><emph render="bold">Series II: Other Organizations and Individuals,
        1920s-1966</emph>features a wide range of materials documenting:</p>

      <p>Individuals and organizations associated with the three main strands of left-radical
        political philosophies, political parties, and culture: Communism, Socialism, and Anarchism,
        including a biographical portrait (released in the early 1930s) of United States Socialist
        Party leader Eugene V. Debs, with footage of Debs, his wife and his brother; a 1936 newsreel
        produced by Confederacion Nacional del Trabajo-Federacion Anarquista de Iberica (National
        Confederation of Labor-Iberian Anarchist Federation," CNT-FAI) and narrated in English by
        prominent American anarchist exile, Emma Goldman (one of two known extant recordings of the
        famous orator's voice) of the funeral of the Spanish Civil War anarchist militia leader,
        Buenaventura Durruti, with footage of Durruti in life, as well as anarchists and members of
        the Republican Government attending the funeral; the pleasures of Camp Tamiment, a Socialist
        summer resort in the Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, with young adults engaged in a wide
        range of vigorous outdoor recreational activities and clowning, as well as appearances by
        Bertha Mailly, Ben Josephson and Algernon Lee, Socialist Party stalwarts and moving spirits
        and supporters of the Socialist Party-associated Rand School of Social Science; playful
        scenes from a picnic held by the Hungarian branch of the (U.S. Communist Party-sponsored)
        International Workers Order; a 1938 May Day Parade (in color and in black and white) in New
        York City, featuring contingents, floats, banners, and signs with a multiplicity of slogans
        on contemporary issues, representing the CPUSA and a broad spectrum of Communist
        Party-associated or left-leaning labor unions and other organizations.</p>

      <p>Organizational life and activities of the New York City-based labor union, District 65-UAW,
        including a televised membership meeting of department store employees considering a strike,
        with union president, David Livingston, leading the discussion; a rally (co-sponsored with
        the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) held in New York City's
        garment district to protest the murder of Emmett Till, and a short government-sponsored film
        about an art show by union members.</p>

      <p>The American and international umbrella labor organizations, the Jewish Labor Committee
        (JLC), and International Labour Organisation (ILO), including a 1920s film about the ILO
        with exterior and interiors of its headquarters and officials in Geneva, Switzerland; a
        small amount of footage from the 1935 International Labor Conference, held in Geneva, with a
        few seconds of the American delegation to the Conference containing what may be the only
        existing moving images of Grace Abbott (American social reformer, teacher, and writer and
        colleague of Jane Addams at Hull House); and the Jewish Labor Committee-produced film,
          <title render="italic">Nos Maisons d'Enfants</title>(1949), shot in France (and narrated
        in Yiddish) to support the JLC's activities on behalf orphaned or destitute Jewish child
        survivors of World War II.</p>

      <p>Progressive American politicians (mainly from New York City and state), including election
        campaign speeches, appearances at various events, and endorsements of New York governor
        Herbert H. Lehman, New York City mayors Fiorello H. La Guardia, William O' Dwyer, Robert F.
        Wagner, Jr.; city councilmen Paul O'Dwyer and Abraham Beame; and television interviews with
        United States senator Wayne L. Morse.</p>

      <p>Daily life of poor and working-class children and adults in New York City during the Great
        Depression, shot by photographer John Albok in black and white and color, including
        shoeshine boys, children selling flowers, children diving for pennies in the East River,
        street dancers, and pushcart vendors, homeless African-American adults living under elevated
        subway train tracks, hungry people rummaging through garbage, and most unique, the
        JLC-sponsored 1936 "Counter-Olympics" - the World Labor Athletic Carnival, a two-day event
        held at the City's Randall's Island to protest the holding of the 1936 Olympics in Nazi
        Germany.</p>
