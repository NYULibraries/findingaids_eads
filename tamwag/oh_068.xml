    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p>The Squatters' Collective Oral History Project was initiated by Tamiment Library in 2008 as a larger effort to document the squatters' movement in New York City. In 2008 Jeremy Sorgen, and undergraduate student at New York University, conducted seven oral history interviews on behalf of the Tamiment Library. The project was later continued by Amy Starecheski who conducted an additional thirty-seven interviews as research for her Ph.D. dissertation in Cultural Anthropology at the City University of New York, which focused on squatting and the transformation of squats into limited equity, low-income co-ops. </p><p>The history of squatting in New York City can be traced back to the nineteenth century, but the movement documented by this oral history project began as an outgrowth of an economic and housing crisis in the 1970s. Reacting to a lack of affordable housing and displacement caused by urban renewal projects, a number of city residents sought alternative housing by occupying vacant buildings in the city. Squatters in New York City were a diverse group that included bohemian artists, activists, undocumented immigrants, and displaced locals, among others. Throughout the 1990s, building owners and city officials worked to evict many of the squats, and while many were torn down or reclaimed by the city, squatters staged a number of successful efforts which allowed them to remain in their buildings. By the end of the 1990s, a number of squatters who still retained control of their buildings approached the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (UHAB), a non-profit organization dedicated to converting city-owned buildings into low-income cooperatives, in an attempt to establish legal ownership of their homes. Over the years that followed, squatters in the Lower East Side began negotiations with UHAB and eventually reached a deal in 2002, which allowed UHAB to acquire eleven buildings that would eventually be sold back to residents once they were renovated and brought up to code. Many of the squats struggled to complete renovations to their buildings, however, and as of 2013 only five of the eleven buildings completed the legalization process.</p>  </bioghist>

<p>This collection was created in two parts. Interviews from this first part of this project were created by a Jeremy Sorgen, an undergraduate student at New York University, on behalf of the Tamiment Library. Interviews from the second part of this project were created by Amy Starecheski for her scholarly research and later donated to Tamiment Library. Upon receipt of this second set of interviews, a finding aid was created to describe the entire collection, at which point interviews were divided into two series based on creator. Biographical and contextual information accompanying interviews were provided by Amy Starecheski, and later modified to conform to current archival descriptive standards (DACS).</p>  </processinfo>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>This collection is comprised of 44 interviews documenting the experiences of individuals living as squatters in New York City between the 1970s and the 2000s. The majority of squatters interviewed in this collection lived in Manhattan's Lower East Side, but the collection also contains discussion of squats in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the South Bronx. Individuals interviewed for this project come from diverse backgrounds and speak to the multitude of experiences among squatters. </p><p>Interviews in this collection address the general experience of life as a squatter in New York, and a large portion focus specifically on the process of transforming squats into legal, limited equity, low-income co-ops. In their discussions about legalization, interviewees recount their negotiations with the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (UHAB), gentrification, reasons for seeking legalization, and  their general opinions about the process. A number of interviews in this collection also touch on squatters' experiences, discussing the politics, organization, and social structure of squats. Several interviews also highlight the experiences of women and minorities living in squats, addressing issues including discrimination, underrepresentation, and child rearing. Additionally, the collection contains a number of interviews with housing rights activists who assisted squatters in their attempts to gain ownership of their buildings. </p><p>Oral history interviews in Series I: Interviews by Jeremy Sorgen were recorded as audio files, which were transferred to Access and Master CDs. Files from Series II: Interviews by Amy Starecheski were recorded as digital audio files and also consist of transcripts and JPEG images of the interviewees. </p>  </scopecontent>

He describes the Yippie squatting actions of the late 1970s and the Pope of Pot, a squatter, drug dealer, and cult leader. He discusses the importance of food, beer, and pot as organizing tools. Wade also describes the development and defense of La Plaza Cultural, where in 1986 they fed up to 500 people a day; some of those people opened Serenity House. He discusses the mounting tensions over Tompkins Square Park in the late 1980s, the riots, and ongoing protests, with which he was centrally involved. He also talks about the 1988 fire at 319 8th Street, and subsequent eviction and demolition of the building. The first session of the interview ends suddenly with a discussion of the May Day and Pot Parade actions in 1990. In the second session, Wade discusses the Triad, Tia Scott, his struggles with drug and alcohol addiction in the 1990s, the defense of the ABC Community Center, the 13th Street eviction, the eviction of Dos Blocos, and anarchist/communist dynamics in anti-war activism during the Persian Gulf War. He discusses the archives at Tamiment, his own archives, and the importance of history. He talks about how he got sober. Wade talks about the pig roasts he used to organize for May Day. He also discusses the legalization process, his experiences of becoming a homeowner, and the potential for squatting today.</p></scopecontent><bioghist id="aspace_83a1370c6756eab008d78fa03ff9c053"><head>Biographical/Historical note</head><p>Gerald Wade, aka Jerry the Peddler, grew up in west Texas. He was raised by his father and grandparents, and left home at age 15, which he notes as common experience among people in the squats. At 17 he joined the army. Having been a teenager in the 1960s, he acquired an "us against them" attitude, and during his time in the army became involved in Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and anti-war activism, even while living on a base in California. When he was supposed to go to Vietnam, Wade went AWOL and lived in the hills in Big Sur for a month. He spent time in Los Angeles and then moved to Fort Worth, Texas where he was involved with draft counseling and the White Panthers. After getting arrested for being AWOL several times he went to Washington, DC for the 1971 May Day protests, where he was detained in RFK Stadium with 20,000 other protesters. He stayed in DC and got involved with the Yippies, who he cites as an important influence on the squatting scene. Between 1974 and 1980 started a relationship, had begun working steadily, and withdrew from politics. After his relationship ended in 1980, however, Wade moved to New York where he once again became involved in political activism. In New York he became connected with people in The Triad, squatted buildings on 7th Street by Avenue D, organized by Everything for Everybody, and after spending some time living in Tompkins Square Park settled in a squatted building on 9th Street. Wade also helped to organize Rock Against Regan, a touring concert, and when the group returned to NYC in 1984, and Wade and others from the group opened the building at 319 East 8th Street. After that point a number of buildings opened up along 8th Street.</p></bioghist></c><c id="aspace_ref81" level="file"><did><unittitle>Steven Englander: Oral History Interview by Jeremy Sorgen</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">2 item</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="2012/2012" type="inclusive">Apr 6, 2008</unitdate><container id="aspace_b65363d98c4ce295cfa6e4aebf9e01e0" label="Mixed Materials" type="Item">OH068_Englander_04062008</container><container id="aspace_afb6a656b2b37944dbd17ee5afa091c9" label="Master cd" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_afb6a656b2b37944dbd17ee5afa091c9" type="Cd">OH-68-002-01  / OH-68-002-02 </container><container id="aspace_c89dbc42c218879362e01eb97b32c01d" label="Access cd" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_c89dbc42c218879362e01eb97b32c01d" type="Cd">OH-68-002-01  / OH-68-002-02 </container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_aab13fcd59753148a3c29999f45481cc"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>In this interview Steven Englander discusses the 1980 founding of ABC No Rio and its surrogate parent organization Collaborative Projects (Colab). He discusses ABC No Rio's changing relationships with squatting and politics, describing the process by which No Rio became a social and practical hub of the squatting scene in the mid-1990s and how squatters played a central role in direct action campaigns to protect No Rio. </p><p>He  describes the decision-making process leading up to the plan to rebuild ABC No Rio rather than renovate. He also discusses the shifting dynamics of ABC No Rio and the local community, noting that few people who currently participate at No Rio actually live on the Lower East Side. In 1999 Englander moved into Umbrella House, a squat on Avenue C, and discusses the organization of that building. He also talks about characters from the scene, and why he would not characterize it as a movement, arguing that it did not go beyond squatting as a practice, or extend beyond the neighborhood and did not question private property.</p></scopecontent><bioghist id="aspace_67c90d179b4691f722a222b8ad4d097f"><head>Biographical/Historical note</head><p>Steven Englander grew up in Wisconsin, the child of a pediatrician and a nurse. He attended private school and was raised in a comfortable, liberal environment with an emphasis on social justice. Drawn to the city's mythos, in 1980 he moved to New York City to attend New York University's film school. After becoming interested in Situationist critiques of media and Marxist economic theory in the mid-1980s, Englander got involved in the anarchist scene and later squatting. While working part-time as a production assistant and taxi driver, he wrote zines, fiction, and non-fiction about urbanism and political events. He was involved with the Black Eye zine, the Anarchist Switchboard, and ABC No Rio. In 1990 he became the assistant director of ABC No Rio. He later moved into No Rio as a squatter in 1994, with others, to defend the space against possible self-help eviction by the city. In 1997, he and all other residents at No Rio willingly vacated as part of a deal with the city to preserve No Rio as a community space, including a print shop, darkroom, computer room, and zine library. After almost a decade of raising money for renovations, in 2006 ABC No Rio acquired title to the building and began planning to rebuild.</p></bioghist></c><c id="aspace_ref9" level="file"><did><unittitle>Mac McGil: Oral History Interview by Jeremy Sorgen</unittitle><physdesc altrender="whole"><extent altrender="materialtype spaceoccupied">4 items</extent></physdesc><unitdate normal="2008/2008" type="inclusive">Apr 4, 2008</unitdate><container id="aspace_05bd47c7a12e5220d116097d3d176707" label="Master cd" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_05bd47c7a12e5220d116097d3d176707" type="Cd">OH-68-003-01 / OH-68-003-02</container><container id="aspace_73a25ebc6502953d50b6fb6962f5efed" label="Access cd" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_73a25ebc6502953d50b6fb6962f5efed" type="Cd">OH-68-003-01 / OH-68-003-02</container></did><userestrict id="aspace_787ec53ebaa2fb754130d1e86e757701"><head>Use Restrictions</head><p>The Tamiment Library and Robert F.

Later, she describes squatter politics and art, including squatter May Day, and John the Communist. She recalls dumpster diving to get food for the 13th Street community kitchen and being bullied by Butch, who terrorized the neighborhood. Cubit argues that the buildings with more people of color in them were evicted over time, while the majority white buildings were allowed to become co-ops; with gentrification squatted buildings have been literally and metaphorically white-washed. In the interview she mentions that when she sees people from that era on the streets she feels they avoid her. Cubit noticed that squatters were mostly white and middle class, and there were few black people, fewer black women and wondered if she was a token. She describes the cliquishness of the buildings on 13th Street, factionalization in the squatter community and tensions with other neighborhood residents, yet she still remembers it as a utopia of creativity, independence, and community. She recalls using piss buckets, stealing cable, and heating with wood stoves.</p></scopecontent><bioghist id="aspace_dbd96b74bdc900c056d7fefc07678106"><head>Biographical/Historical note</head><p>Carla Cubit grew up in Kansas City, Missouri, where she was raised by her mother. She moved around frequently during childhood, and her mother struggled with alcohol and crack addiction. As a result Cubit often lived with her aunts. When she was 18, her boyfriend was killed, and Cubit left Missouri for New York City, hoping to get into theater. She had no place to stay, and ended up in shelters, where she was diagnosed as schizophrenic. She attended Borough of Manhattan Community College, studying liberal arts and became aware of alternative lifestyles, politics, and squatting. She also got involved with Unforgotten Voices, a homeless arts group, Hobo Theater, anti-psychiatry groups, and participated in a homeless encampment in City Hall Park. Cubit did some work days at a squat on 13th Street and then was invited to live there.

Her father was a chemist and her mother was a teacher. After briefly attending art school she left Australia to go travelling, and stayed in San Francisco for a year, living in a punk rock warehouse and working in a punk rock club. She intended to only visit New York for a while in 1984, but felt instantly at home and decided to stay in the city where she worked in night clubs. In the winter of 1987 Wrigley started squatting at Bullet Space, after paying rent for a place in Williamsburg that had no heat or water.</p></bioghist></c><c id="aspace_ref91" level="file"><did><unittitle>Johanna Bartelt: Oral History by Amy Starecheski</unittitle><unitdate normal="2010/2010" type="inclusive">Dec 18, 2010</unitdate><container id="aspace_9443e90c7fb7a855c137ea86d1230cf8" label="Mixed Materials" type="Item">OH068_Bartelt_12182010</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_15400f1b7310f1c53e296d5d9da333a5"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>In this interview Johanna Bartlet talks about her experience as a squatter and discusses some of hardships of living in the cold and dusty squats.
