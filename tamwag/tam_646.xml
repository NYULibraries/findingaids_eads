            <p>At the time of accessioning, the Tamiment Library's director, Timothy Naftali, decided to retain clippings and pamphlets related to American Communism, world Communism, and the politics of U.S. education. All original records and notes created by Julian and Gertrude Ascher were retained, but monographs were returned to Laura Chenven. In total, approximately six linear feet of monographs, pamphlets, and news clippings with inactive mold, many of which were already duplicated in the Tamiment Library's holdings, were not retained as part of the collection.</p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Julian and Gertrude Ascher were involved in the Teachers' Union (TU) of New York City. The TU was organized in 1916 and chartered as Local 5 of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). Many of the leading activists in the TU were members of the Communist Party, though the group also contained more moderate socialists and liberals. Eventually, the conflict between these two ideologically different groups would cause the majority of the TU's membership to withdraw in 1935 and found the Teachers' Guild. The TU disbanded entirely in 1964.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The collection documents Julian and Gertrude Ascher's work in the field of education and their involvement with the New York City Teachers' Union (TU). The collection includes news clippings, newsletters, reports, pamphlets, and curriculum materials. Many materials on U.S. and international current events and history were likely collected as research for lesson planning or other educational purposes.</p>

            <p>The materials in this collection were generated and collected by Julian and Gertrude Ascher.

            <p>The materials that were retained after preservation assessment were rehoused in archival quality boxes. Two boxes of materials were originally housed in moldy folders, but the materials themselves were not moldy. The moldy folders were replaced with new archival quality folders, and the original folder titles were transcribed onto the new folders. These boxes now comprise Boxes 7 and 8 of the collection. A collection-level finding aid was created to describe the collection, but no physical processing or arrangement was done at this time.</p>
