            <p>This collection was in the last box of the American Association of University Professors Committee on Academic Freedom Records (TAM 407) when they were initially received. The American Association of University Professors Committee on Academic Freedom Records had likely been donated to the Tamiment Library by Marilyn B. Young. In November 2009, approximately one linear foot of materials were separated and the collection was established as the Alfred F. Young Papers. The accession number associated with this collection is 2009.096.</p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Alfred F. Young apparently taught at the Communist Party USA's Jefferson School of Social Science in New York City. Additionally, he was a historian who primarily studied late 18th century American history. He received his PhD from Northwestern University in 1958. He may have been a member of the American Association of University Professors Academic Freedom Committee, as his Papers followed theirs in the last box of their records when they were initially received.</p>
