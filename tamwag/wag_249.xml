            <p>The collection consists of large scrapbooks dating approximately from 1948 to 1962 containing conference and meeting reports, as well as statistical data gathered by the TWUA's Research Department.</p>

            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>The Textile Workers Union of America (TWUA) was an industrial union of textile workers established through the Congress of Industrial Organizations in 1939 and which merged with the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America to become the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union (ACTWU) in 1976. As a leading organization in the CIO's "Operation Dixie," it led numerous organizing campaigns in the union-resistant South, aiming to help textile workers achieve higher wages, health insurance and other benefits, and to ensure fair labor practices. The TWUA was able to organize new plants and revive some moribund organizations, but it was unable to achieve a breakthrough win which would organize the whole industry. The TWUA's textile locals eventually became part of UNITE/HERE, a manufacturing and hospitality workers union.</p>
