                        <p>Hilary Beirne was interviewed on the 26th of October, 2009 at the Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by James Herron and Linda Dowling Almeida. The topics discussed were wide and varied, starting with his background, growing up in County Roscommon, Ireland and following through his life from college days to working in Ireland in the 1970s and ‘80s to immigrating to the United States in the late ‘80s and ending with his distinguished work with the St. Patrick’s Day Parade.</p>
                        <p>Beirne discusses his early life, growing up with nine brothers and sisters in a large farmhouse that his father, a veterinary surgeon, purchased around the time Beirne was born. He talks about his experiences in National School, and the effects that the small learning community, corporal punishment, and religious doctrine had on his education. He went to secondary school, earning high enough marks to attend college and earn a degree in agricultural studies. He discusses his first few jobs in Ireland, where he worked on projects that redesigned the way Irish farms operate and store various crops.</p>
                        <p>He eventually left his job and immigrated to the U.S. to become a science teacher in the Bronx. It was at this time that he became involved in the New York City St. Patrick’s Day Parade, upon which a large portion of this interview is based. Beirne discusses the finances, the history, the operations and the future of the parade in great detail. He provides an excellent behind-the-scenes view of the production of one of the largest parades in the world. Beirne also discusses, in great detail, the various other Irish fraternal clubs of which he is a member.</p>
                        <p>As a teacher, Beirne discusses his instructing methods and how he engages the student. He also spends time discussing how he became a teacher and the reasons why. He also talks about what he thinks makes a good teacher, and the necessary traits to perform the job well.</p>
                        <p>He then returns to a broader discussion on why Irish-American heritage is important to this country, stating, “40 million Americans trace their heritage back to Ireland…” in order to show just how important the parade is.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the interview, Beirne takes breaks from discussing his life and the parade to talk about his family. He discusses his twin brother and the unique skills he possesses that his twin does not and vice versa. He discusses the odd relationship his siblings (2 brothers, 7 sisters) had with his parents, specifically, the love and strong bond they all had with their mother and poor relationship they had with their father. He also talks about the day he left Ireland and the effects his leaving had on his mother.</p>
                        <p>This oral history was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview is 2 hours and 28 minutes long, on 3 CDs. The interview took place on October 29, 2009, and the interviewers were James Herron and Linda Dowling Almedia.</p>

                        <p>In this interview, Sgt. Burns discusses a range of topics, from his family's history in New York City to his own role in the New York community. Sgt Burns spends most of the interview discussing his heritage and his family history, which is an interest of his. He describes his attempts to trace his ancestry to Ireland through his paternal family, the Burns, which leads him to County Cork. His maternal family, the Fitzgeralds, led him to County Galway. Then he describes his family's place in New York, where they lived and worked.</p>
                        <p>Burns remembers his mother, Josephine Marie Fitzgerald, born to Eddie Fitzgerald and Anna Erika Octavia Johanson. The Fitzgeralds he has traced back to County Galway, Ireland, but his grandmother, whom the family called Grandma Svenska, was from Sweden. Burns also discusses the Burns side of the family. His great-grandfather was the first to emigrate from Ireland and he believes the family is from Cork. Neither of Sgt. Burns' grandmothers were Irish. His paternal grandmother was Mary Gale, a an immigrant, believed to be French German. Burns discusses speculation and 'Burns legend' about her emigration but he admits that very little is actually known about it. The speculation is that she was at some point in her youth orphaned and migrated to Pittsburgh. What is definite, Burns discovered, is that Mary Gale and Andrew Burns were living in the same Hell's Kitchen (a famously Irish area on Manhattan's West Side) boarding house, according to the 1900 census.</p>
                        <p>Burns discusses his paternal grandfather, Andrew Burns, at length. He recalls Pop Burns, as he called him, fondly, often calling him quite a character. He tells stories about Pop Burns' business, hauling vinegar for Fleischmann's in New York. He talks about their summers in Rockaway Beach and stories about his Pop's swimming prowess. Burns discusses Pop growing up in Hell's Kitchen and their style of dress. He also talks about Pop Burns and his friends raising pit bulls on the roof tops and his grandfather's choice to not drink, referring to him as a teetotaler.</p>
                        <p>Burns also fondly discusses his mother, Josephine Marie Fitzgerald, who grew up in the Yorkville section of Manhattan's Upper East Side. As a young woman she worked as a secretary at Bonwit Teller, an upscale New York City department store, now closed. Burns remarks about his mother's exceptionally small feet, that were the same size as all the sample shoes delivered to the department store. One of the perks of her job was taking home the sample pairs she liked. He observed that his mother always had the most stylish footwear in the neighborhood. Burns also discusses a story, that he could never verify, that his mother played the piano at Carnegie Hall for a school performance while attending Dominican Academy on Manhattan's Upper East Side.</p>
                        <p>Burns speaks about his different career choices, including six years in the Army Reserves. Then he discusses his tenure with the New York Police Department (NYPD). He recalls his entry into the police academy on 20 June 1966 and being out on the street to keep the peace during riots in Harlem two weeks later on 4 July 1966. Burns spent 27 years working for the NYPD in various aspects. He remained at the 25th precinct in Harlem until 1970. Burns then became a plain clothes officer working for public morals, a division of the NYPD that deals with liquor, gambling, and prostitution violations. Burns was transferred to Glendale, Queens, for two years which he describes as the most boring part of his police career. While Burns was investigating recruits the NYPD came out with their Law Enforcement Assistance Program. Burns took advantage of the program and completed a degree in Criminal Justice at Saint John's University, resuming a college career that he quit to join the Army Reserves. During this time Burns was also studying to be a sergeant and working full time. As a sergeant with the NYPD he began working at the Office of the Deputy Commissioner, Public Information (DCPI) where Burns was the voice of the NYPD. Burns discusses how this change in his police career impacted hi life after the NYPD. Burns released official NYPD statements to the press. It was here that he became interested in the public relations business. He decided to go back to school and received his masters degree with honors from New York University in Media Ecology in 1979 or 1980. Five years later Sgt. Burns became an adjunct professor at NYU in the same program, while still working with the DCPI. Following his police career Sgt. Burns successfully opened two public relations firms. Burns also took an active role in helping his children with their careers.</p>
                        <p>Sgt. Burn's children are a main focus of the interview. He initially lived in Astoria, Queens, with his wife and young family but moved to Valley Stream, Long Island, where he raised his family. Burns eldest child, Mary, attended the Fashion Institute of Technology and lives on Long Island. His two sons Edward and Brian, whom he calls Irish twins because they were born so close to one another in the tradition of many Catholic Irish families, are both involved in the film and television industry. Edward is a writer/director/actor for various films, including the movie that began his career, 
                            <emph render="italic">The Brothers McMullen</emph>, which won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 1995. Burns talks with pride about his son's accomplishments. Brian is also a writer/producer for various programs including the hit HBO television show, 
                            <emph render="italic">Entourage</emph>. Sgt. Burns discussed at length his views on parenting and education.</p>
                        <p>Sgt Burns also discusses his involvement in a group called the First Friday Club - the name alludes to a Catholic practice of attending mass for the first Friday of nine consecutive months to receive a special blessing. This group drew New York Irish American writers, politicians and intellectuals and would meet for lunch at Eamonn Doran's. Sgt. Burns describes the lunch as a meeting of friends that sometimes lasted from noon to six or seven at night. Writers like Frank and Malachy McCourt, William Kennedy, and Terry Moran were in regular attendance. Sgt. Burns describes this group as a small gathering of 10 to 12 that grew into a much larger gathering of thirty or more with the rising celebrity of members like Frank McCourt and his son Edward.</p>
                        <p>Sergeant Edward Burns was interviewed on 14 November 2008 at the Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Emily Mahoney and Professor Linda Dowling Almeida. Sgt. Burns' oral history interview was digitally recorded on a Marantz CD420. The interview is one hour, 57 minutes and 54 seconds long, recorded on two CDs, and has been logged in ten minute intervals.</p>

                        <p>Burns was born in Woodside, Queens, but grew up in Valley Stream, Long Island, which he affectionately calls “the burbs,” referring to the area as a suburb of New York City. He discusses his experience as a young Irish Catholic and his impressions and memories of a suburban childhood. Particularly interesting are his childhood revelations of being Irish.</p>
                        <p>Burns describes the family history, as he knows it, of his mother and father. He details his mother’s childhood, as the daughter of Irish immigrants, growing up without a mother and a father who worked as a sandhog and who was often absent. He believes that his father’s family emigrated from Ireland during the potato famine. Burns traces the professions of his various paternal relatives, including a great-grandfather who owned a horse and carriage trucking company on the west side of Manhattan.</p>
                        <p>Burns explains the process of making 
                            <emph render="italic">The Brothers McMullen</emph> and the various challenges that he faced in shooting the film on a low budget. He tells a few stories of the more unique things he had to do to get “the shot”, including sneaking into a graveyard.</p>
                        <p>Burns took 
                            <emph render="italic">The Brothers McMullen</emph> to the Sundance Film Festival in 1995. Burns’ retelling of his acceptance to Sundance is particularly interesting and at the end of his story, Burns notes “Print the legend.” 
                            <emph render="italic">The Brothers McMullen</emph> won the Grand Jury Prize, which is the equivalent of the Oscar for Best Picture. Burns relates his memories of winning the actual award and all the strangeness that he felt in the moments after the announcement, including a possible embrace with “Sam Jackson”, the actor Samuel L. Jackson to the rest of us.</p>
                        <p>Burns also discusses the roles of the Irish in entertainment and how they are portrayed in movies and television. Remarking about the Irish content and references in 
                            <emph render="italic">The Brothers McMullen</emph>, “none of this has been in a film, so I’m going to put all of it in” almost to the point of going overboard. He also discusses prominent Irish authors whose work he enjoys. Burns explains that he has attempted to adapt a couple of Irish-American novels into films, but to date none have worked.</p>
                        <p>Burns continues to discuss the portrayal of Irish Americans on film and television. He notes that most of the Irish-American characters on film and television tend to be police officers, fire fighters or other stereotypically Irish professions. What Burns says had not been portrayed before was an Irish-American family and their everyday existence.</p>
                        <p>Burns discusses his family’s drive for the next generation to leave the New York suburbs and return to Manhattan, which Burns has done. Burns’ father pushed Burns and his brother to attend college and to pursue the American dream of “doing better” than the previous generation. Burns juxtaposes this ambition with the fact that none of the parents of his friends in Valley Stream had gone to college. He draws the analogy of his own social climbing to the old saying “When your grandfather came here there were signs that said ‘No Irish Need Apply’ and in 1963 we put JFK in the White House.”</p>
                        <p>Near the conclusion of the interview, Burns defines what his perception of Irish American is and what it means to him.</p>
                        <p>Edward Burns was interviewed on October 30, 2007 at Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Callan Stout, Linda Dowling Almeida, and Joe Ready. This oral history was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview is 1 hour and 25 minutes long, recorded on two CDs and has been broken into tracks of ten-minute segments.</p>

                        <p>In this oral history Cassidy, author and scholar, traces the link between his family history his involvement in Irish Studies, and the origins of his research which culminated in How the Irish Invented Slang. In a largely chronological manner, Cassidy starts by discussing his Brooklyn roots; his parents; his education; Vietnam; his battle with drugs and twenty-three month stay at Phoenix House; friendships with comedian George Carlin and musician Kenny Rankin; and the meaning of Irish identity. After starting off with a clear New York/East Coast focus, the narrative then shifts geographically to Cassidy’s life in California and most particularly in San Francisco. Topics like his writing (his screenplay, 
                            <emph render="italic">The Volunteer</emph>, was sold to Francis Ford Coppola), labor organizing, and his move into teaching are covered.

                        <p>Danny Cassidy was interviewed in his home in San Francisco on July 20, 2008 by Peter Quinn. This oral history was digitally recorded on a Marantz PMD660. It is 148 minutes and 49 seconds long, on three CDs, and has been logged at five minute intervals.</p>

                        <p>Some of the themes that D'Arcy focuses on in these interviews include: class divisions in Irish post-war community and how Kathleen related in an up-scale school environment; growing up in an extremely Irish-oriented household; parents were very open and Kathleen thinks that they were unique in that way (track 4); she was in a convent, as a novitiate, for a year; McNiff school of dancing (track 5); and her work in Dublin in the early 1970s.</p>
                        <p>This oral history was digitally recorded on a Marantz PMD660. The interview took place over two sessions: February 12, 2009 and April 22, 2009.

                        <p>Joan Dolan’s first memories come from her time as a child growing up in Ireland. Her mother had moved her there from New York when she was only two and a half years old to live with her grandparents and her uncle. She had grown up on a small farm in Killarue, and she attended National School in Cavan until the age of eleven. Her parents and had come back to Ireland in order to bring her back to the United States. She has thought about her return to America at age eleven after spending nine years in Ireland. Joan only knew life on the small farm on which she lived. She felt that moving to New York was both exciting; however she has second guessed her parents’ decision to bring her back to the United States. She does not have regrets about returned when she did, as affirms that she has a wonderful life here. She does; however, remember that her uncle wished that she could have stayed until she were grown up, as she brought happiness to the lives of two older people and a bachelor. She thinks perhaps she should have left as a seventeen or eighteen year old. Joan admits that is was difficult reunite with her parents since she really did not know them. She began to know her parents only after she was brought back from Ireland when she was eleven years old in April of 1948. She describes her father as a quiet man who was dedicated to his family and his work. Her mother was a talented cook who had received on the job training in her first years as an immigrant in Providence, Rhode Island.</p>
                        <p>Although she is happy with the way events of her life have turned out, Joan wonders what her life would have been like if she had stayed in Ireland. She does feel; however, that she would have had to have left Ireland in order to immigrate to the United States anyway. It just would have been a matter of time as there would have been little room for her on the farm, and there were few jobs to be found in Ireland. Since she did return at a young age; however, she had to adjust to American life. She recalls the drastic change, “From Killarue to Times Square, my goodness.” She attended St. Jean Baptiste High School on the Upper East Side where she admits that it was difficult to fit in at first. The immigrant mentality focused on assimilation. Joan remembers that she did not want to project an image of Irishness in school; rather, she wished to be seen as an American. These feelings changed as she grew past her adolescence, and she wished to explore and promote her Irish culture.</p>
                        <p>When Joan was twelve years old, her parents enrolled her in Irish dancing classes in 1949 under the direction James McKenna. She describes him as a strict, yet effective instructor. She had lost interest in dancing after a year of lessons, and she decided to quit. When she was nineteen, Joan resumed Irish dancing under the direction of Peter and Cyril McNiff. She became one of their ceili dancers, and she danced competitively for four years. She describes her time she spent dancing as one of the greatest parts of her life—she danced because she enjoyed dancing, and so she could be around the friends she made in her ceili, including Andy McCann, Eva McManus, Peter McNiff, Cyril McNiff, Hannah O’Leary, Larry Reddigan, Peter Smith, Gerry Wallace, Lori Walsh, Mike Bergin Peggy Bergin, Edmund Brown, Joan Cass, Eugene Clancy, Pat Clancy, and Jimmy Erwin. She described the ceili uniforms of her team as being quite simple—green skirts, white stockings, white shirt, and a black dance jacket. She compares those more traditional outfits to many of the new styles used in Irish dancing today. She very much approves of popular productions such as Riverdance because have brought Irish dancing into the mainstream; however, the outfits—wigs, outrageous colors, and fancy embroidery—really do not embody the spirit of the dance; rather they commercialize the Irish dancing.</p>
                        <p>After Joan married Felix Dolan, she lived in the Woodlawn and Highbridge sections of the Bronx. Both areas were decidedly Irish; however once she had kids, the Dolan family moved to Golden’s Bridge in Westchester County, NY. She believes that she has gravitated towards people with common interests. Even though this section of Westchester was ethnically diverse, Joan managed to find many Irish friends, including her best friend Ann McEnearny.</p>
                        <p>Joan sincerely believes that it is important that her Irish culture lives on through the generations. Joan gave her children traditional Irish names, and she afforded all of them Irish dancing lessons. Her children have now named their own children traditional Irish names, and some of them have begun Irish dance lessons. In addition to dance, Joan also believed that attending Irish events as a family promoted the preservation of Irish culture. Joan has practiced what she believes as the Dolan family has marched annually with the Gaelic League in the St. Patrick’s Day Parade. Today Joan continues to attend ceilis as she still retains her passion for dancing.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Dunn discusses a range of topics, beginning with his childhood growing up in Sunnyside, Queens. After failing out of St. Teresa’s Catholic School, Woodside, Queens, in the 7th grade, Dunn went on to finish the year at St. Anthony’s Catholic School in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. At the age of 16 Dunn dropped out of Queens Vocational High School and began a series of part-time jobs that lasted for a year. When he was 17 Dunn enlisted in the Navy. He was stationed in Guantanamo, Cuba for four years, and was discharged at the age of 21.</p>
                        <p>Dunn discusses his time in the Navy where he completed the G.E.D. (General Equivalency Diploma). While in the service, he also prepared for the city civil service test. He took the exam for the fire service. After passing the test and returning to New York, Dunn began his career as a fireman. He quickly climbed up the ranks of the fire service, moving from rookie fireman to deputy chief, lieutenant, and captain. Dunn then returned to school with the help of the G.I. Bill, and applied to Queens College in New York. Eventually, he received his Bachelors and Master’s Degrees. In 1959, at the age of 24, Dunn married his wife Patricia. He tells of the purchase of their first house in Douglaston, New York and the decoration of its backyard with stone faces and gargoyle statues acquired from torn down buildings in Harlem.</p>
                        <p>Dunn retired in 1999 after serving 42 years as a fireman. Two years later the attacks on the World Trade Center occurred. Dunn remarks upon the construction of these buildings and their collapse. He shares that much of his life post-retirement is spent writing articles and giving lectures on the topic of building construction and fire-safety.</p>
                        <p>Vincent Dunn was interviewed on 13 November 2007 at Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Karen Shua-Haim and Linda Dowling Almeida. This oral history with Vincent Dunn was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview is 1 hour, 56 minutes long, on two CDs and had been logged at ten minute intervals.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Fanning discusses his family background, his childhood in 1950s Norwood, Massachusetts, Irish American literature and his own academic and literary pursuits. Fanning begins the interview with background about his family. His father, Charles Fanning Sr., worked in a variety of jobs before settling as a custodian in Norwood public schools. The Fannings roots are in County Monaghan, Ireland. They immigrated during the famine and became farmers in Needham, Massachusetts. Fanning’s mother Frances Patricia Fanning never worked outside the home. Her mother was born in Cork because her parents, who had immigrated to Boston, had returned to Ireland to settle an estate.</p>
                        <p>Fanning describes his childhood in Norwood which he remembers as an ideal time. He explains the separation in Norwood between the Irish, the Yankees and the new immigrants; mainly the groups were divided geographically by ethnic neighborhoods but there was no animosity between the communities. Fanning also talks about his family’s unique attitude towards the Yankees because in previous generations his family included intermarriages between Irish and Yankees.</p>
                        <p>After attending public schools in Norwood, Fanning explains that he then attended Harvard University despite his guidance counselor’s urging to apply to Boston College. At Harvard, Fanning studied literature. When he graduated, he went to the University of California at Berkley where he pursued graduate studies in English. Fanning explains his interest shifted to teaching so he left Berkley to attend Harvard again for its graduate teaching programs. Fanning also admits while reviewing his education choices that fear of being drafted into the Viet Nam War kept him in school. In his final graduate program at the University of Pennsylvania in 1967 , Fanning explains that he discovered his true passion while pursuing American studies and explored the connection between literature and history. Fanning wrote his dissertation on the work of Finley Peter Dunne which examined the Chicago Irish. Fanning also talks about his mentors John Kelleher, professor at Harvard, and Tom Brown at the University of Massachusetts, whose advice directed him toward Dunne.</p>
                        <p>Fanning talks about his teaching career which began at Bridgewater State College in Massachusetts and the competition for teaching posts at the time he was finishing his PhD. He briefly mentions his two year stint teaching at the University of Missouri St. Louis before he went to Southern Illinois University at Carbondale where he founded an Irish studies program. Fanning talks about the reception of the Irish studies program which was positive in Carbondale. He also explains the extensive library of Irish literature at Carbondale which includes letters and manuscripts from Joyce and Yeats. Fanning also discusses Irish American literature at length and the future of Irish American literature.</p>
                        <p>Fanning discusses his work beyond his dissertation, which he later developed into his first book published in 1968. He explains his writing process and his upcoming projects which include a memoir and a novel about Chicago in the 1880s.</p>
                        <p>Charles Fanning was interviewed on 4 November 2009 at Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Tara Dougherty and Linda Dowling Almeida. The interview is 1 hour, 58 minutes, and 45 seconds long, on 2 CDs.</p>

                        <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
                        <p>Fr. Grange begins by discussing how his parents met on vacation at Rockaway Beach in Queens, New York. He talks extensively about his relatives and their experiences in New York. His grandparents on his mother’s side were both from Ireland, coming to the United States at an early age. His grandfather eventually became the manager of the Harvard Club of New York City, which along with his investments, allowed him to purchase a brownstone on Alexander Avenue, “the Irish Fifth Avenue,” in the South Bronx. Recalling his father’s side, Fr. Grange reveals that his grandmother had had three husbands prior to his grandfather. His grandfather and all of his uncles were policemen, and his aunt worked for the New York City Parks department. Fr. Grange compares his immigrant family’s entry into civil service positions with the current trend of Mexican immigrants joining the ranks of city employees.</p>
                        <p>Although his mother’s parents did not talk much about Ireland, Fr. Grange explains that he does not think they were involved with the insurrections against the British around the time of the Easter Rising in 1916. Coming to the U.S. at very young ages, Fr. Grange believes they were told to leave home because there was not enough food, and as a result they never went back to Ireland. Instead, his grandfather participated in the Irish American community in New York, joining the annual Feis, an Irish dance and music competition. His father was a very steady man, refusing to drink because his younger brother died from alcoholism.</p>
                        <p>Fr. Grange discusses his mother’s siblings, explaining how his mother’s eldest brother was thrown out of the New York Seminary. His aunt was a nun in the Sisters of Charity order. Another uncle was also temporarily thrown out of the seminary, but eventually organized a missionary group in Harlem in the 1930s, which conducted hundreds of conversions and baptisms a year for the predominantly African-American community that had migrated from the South in the 1920s. Discussing another aunt, Fr. Grange describes the abusive relationship she had with her husband. She is now the last survivor of that generation. The child born after her died early, which strongly affected Fr. Grange’s grandmother. Fr. Grange mentions that later in life, his grandmother had Alzheimer’s, which would cause her to sit in her rocking chair all day, waiting for her husband to return from work.</p>
                        <p>Fr. Grange moves on to talk about his father’s side of the family in Rockaway Beach. He remembers going to their house and being bored because there were not many children to play with, and an episode in which they killed ducks in the backyard. Fr. Grange mostly interacted with his mother’s side of the family. His parents moved around to progressively larger apartments as his family grew, near his grandmother’s home on Alexander Avenue.</p>
                        <p>Fr. Grange describes going to school at St. Jerome’s, where he was taught by the Ursuline nuns for the first six years, and the De La Salle Christian Brothers until secondary school. At that time, St. Jerome’s was a growing parish with many vocations. He remembers that the priests had fancy cars and were very respected in the community. The only priest from Ireland in the parish left to go on a mission to Peru, where he was threatened by the terrorist group, the Shining Path , but survived to afterwards become the Chaplain of Cork University. Fr. Grange discusses another woman he knows who was killed by the Shining Path. Fr. Grange then returns to discussing his schooling, describing the brothers as very strict and penal. After graduating St. Jerome’s, Fr. Grange attended Cathedral Preparatory Seminary in Flushing, Queens, explaining that the students got off on Thursdays instead of Fridays, so that they could not attend dances. Fr. Grange’s twin brother, Joseph, left after the first four years of seminary school, but Fr. Grange stayed on. Before being ordained in 1966, Fr. Grange took a year off to teach English and History at Immaculata High School in Manhattan. After his ordination, Fr. Grange noticed other priests who were learning Spanish and working with the growing communities of Puerto Ricans, which influenced him to go to language school in Puerto Rico.</p>
                        <p>After returning from Puerto Rico, Fr. Grange explains that he was assigned to work at St. Columba School in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. While there, he became more involved with the Puerto Rican community. After six years, Fr. Grange was transferred to Annunciation School in Harlem, which was a primarily Dominican community. When Annunciation was given over to Spanish priests, he took the opportunity to arrange a transfer to St. Jerome’s with the ambition of eventually becoming a pastor. In the 1980s, a large influx of Mexican immigrants started visiting him and attending church at St. Jerome’s. Fr. Grange describes how mass attendance continued to grow over the years despite the difficulties the undocumented Mexican immigrant community faced. Fr. Grange explains that in the late nineties, St. Jerome’s began to physically decay, prompting him to confront Cardinal Egan about funding for the renovation. Cardinal Egan decided to give St. Jerome’s the funding to renovate the Church, but three years later, he awarded the parish to a group of Argentinean priests and transferred Fr. Grange to St. Athanasius in the Bronx. Fr. Grange discusses the tension between the St. Jerome’s parish and their new priests that stems from their cultural and religious differences. Fr. Grange also mentions the problem of illegal immigrants wanting to get married, but not being able to under New York law. Fr. Grange’s new parish, St. Athanasius, is a mostly Puerto Rican community. He expresses concern for the parish, as most of the parishioners are elderly and oftentimes he performs several funerals a week.</p>
                        <p>Fr. Grange explains that part of what has slowed him down recently has been an inflammatory disease called Polymyalgia Rheumatica, which causes severe pain in his back. He goes on to discuss how the changes made during Vatican II have made the Church more compassionate, but that not all religious have embraced the changes. Although there has been an increase in Spanish-speaking priests in the archdiocese, many have not fully invested in the communities they serve. Fr. Grange expresses concern about recently installed Cardinal Timothy Dolan, considering the problematic relationship former Cardinal Egan had with the priests. Fr. Grange goes on to discuss the problematic role of Pope Benedict XVI and the schism in the Church between those who agree with the Vatican II changes and those who do not. He mentions the lack of priests in the South Bronx, and the recent increase in violence.</p>
                        <p>Then Fr. Grange discusses the community’s treatment of priests following the sexual abuse scandals. Fr. Grange comments on the various ways the Church has attempted to improve awareness about sexual abuse. Although there have been some leadership problems and “joy” has left the Church as an institution, Fr. Grange fundamentally believes that God is in the Church.</p>
                        <p>Then Fr. Grange goes on to describe a typical day in his life, which begins with Qigong, Tai-Chi, and meditation. Fr. Grange discusses his love for swimming and how he held the record in his age group for the 100-yard free-style for five consecutive years.</p>
                        <p>Fr. Grange explains that he rarely visits his former parish at St. Jerome’s, except to perform occasional funerals or marriages. Although his family is Irish-American, Fr. Grange does not identify with them, but rather feels a stronger connection with the Mexican community. Then, turning to his former political involvement, Fr. Grange discusses his involvement with the South Bronx Churches, an ecumenical group founded to protect the rights and quality of life for residents of the South Bronx. One of their main causes was to build houses for people in need. Fr. Grange ends by relating a story about the destruction of Church property while he was protesting with South Bronx Churches against poor medical care at Lincoln Hospital, prompting him to write a letter to Cardinal John Joseph O’Connor.</p>
                        <p>Father John Grange was interviewed on 29 October 2009 at Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Caitlin O’Brien and Linda Dowling Almeida. The interview is 1 hour, 51 minutes long, and 39 seconds long, on 2 CDs. The interview took place on October, 2009.</p>

                        <p>Daniel Hartigan, Jr. (born 1926), is an Irish immigrant, born in Limerick, whose father was an ardent follower of Eamon De Valera. His dad's allegiance to De Valera through the 1920s and 1930s cost him and the family dearly. Hartigan Sr.'s political choices led to financial and social reverses for the family and ultimately the migration of Daniel, Jr. and most of his siblings. Life for this IRA family in the west of Ireland during the 20s and through World War II offered few other options.</p>

                        <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
                        <p>Sister Theresa begins the discussion with a description of her parents lives in Ballinlough, County Roscommon, Ireland. She includes information such as what life was like there in general, as well as the work involved with owning a family farm. She recalls that her parents lived on the same street but came over to America separately and for different reasons in the early 1920s.</p>
                        <p>Sister Theresa talks about her parents’ occupations after arriving in America. Her mother worked as a housekeeper and was later promoted to cook. Her father’s occupation as a police officer in combination with her mother’s strong money management enabled the couple to buy their own home. This was the house that Sister grew up in the Brooklyn, New York neighborhood of Bushwick with her two older siblings, James and Mary Anne. When Sister was five, her older brother left to attend the seminary, St. Joseph’s College in Princeton, New Jersey, eventually fulfilling his passion and becoming ordained as a Vincentian priest. Sister explains the differences between Vincentian and diocesan priests, and goes on to describe a typical day for a priest and his duties in general.</p>
                        <p>Sister Theresa attended the single-sex Catholic educational institution St. John the Baptist grammar school. She went on to attend Bishop McDonnell Memorial High School in Brookyln, also a single-sex Catholic school. Sister Theresa mentions that being around religious figures her whole life played a part in motivating her to become a nun. However, after graduating in 1952, she was not yet sure of what she wanted to do, and went on to work in the accounting department at Pfizer Incorporated. After five years, in 1957, Sister Theresa chose to join the Brooklyn Sisters of Mercy. She talks about her various assignments at different schools, ranging from her first teaching assignment in Sunnyside, Queens, to a librarian at St. Patrick’s on Kent Avenue in Brooklyn, as well as her work as principal at Our Lady of Refuge in East Flatbush, Brooklyn.</p>
                        <p>It was during her assignment at St. Patrick’s on Kent Avenue that Vatican II occurred. Sister Theresa describes the changes she saw in the Church, the effects the movement had on Catholic educations and the habit, as well as on the convent itself and the women within it. Sister’s opinion of the reforms were mostly negative. She believes that before Vatican II the women in the convent had a strict schedule that was followed, and without that kind of structure the women felt lost; she points to this as one of the changes that provoked many women to leave. She also disliked the changes in the habit. She discusses in detail the full habit nuns used to wear before Vatican II, as well as why she enjoyed wearing it and why she still wears the modified habit today, even though it is not a requirement. However, she does mention that she enjoyed the new freedom nuns had to vacation and visit family whenever they chose, as compared to before when time away from the convent was limited. She describes her family’s home in Breezy Point, Queens, and the joy it brought her to be able to go back there for vacations. Sister also discusses the effects Vatican II had on the convent, the Church and religion in general, as well as its impact on Catholic educations.</p>
                        <p>Sister Theresa also discusses her Irish identity throughout the interview. She remembers listening to the Irish radio stations with her mother, and mentions that her sister took Irish dancing classes. She describes her Irishness as being inherent, and something that has always simply been a part of her. When asked about her Irish-American identity she explains that although she does not necessarily think about it, she knows she is Irish, and describes herself as more Irish than American, but that the greatness of America is also simply a part of who she is.</p>
                        <p>Sister Theresa ends with a discussion about her current position at Our Lady of Mercy Academy in Syosset, New York, as event coordinator, where she organizes school events and fundraisers. She mentions the various events she handles yearly and the amount of money raised at some of them.</p>
                        <p>This oral history with Sister Theresa Kelly was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview is 2 hours, 28 minutes long, on 3 CDs, and has been logged at ten minute intervals. Sister Theresa Kelly was interviewed on November 8, 2007, at Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Kristina Galati, Linda Dowling Almeida, and Joseph Ready.</p>

                        <p>Some of the key themes that Maguire focuses on are how her attitude to where ‘home’ (Ireland/New York) is has changed over time and how Irish American and Irish-born gays interacted.</p>

                        <p>Pat Mahon discusses a range of topics from his Irish Catholic childhood in the Bronx to international Irish traditional music competitions and performance to life on Wall Street as an Irish Catholic New Yorker.</p>
                        <p>He begins the interview discussing his family life and youth in the changing and diverse neighborhoods of the Bronx in the 1960s. As the oldest son of Irish immigrants, he and his three siblings were educated in Catholic grammar schools and he and his sister both tested into prestigious public high schools. He reflects on the importance of Irish identity for his parents and how they encouraged their children to build their own ethnic identity through music. Pat learned the button accordion and trained and competed with some well-known figures in the field of traditional music including Joannie Madden, Eileen Ivers, and Brian Conway. He describes his experience as the first American to win the All-Ireland championship in 1973 at the Fleadh in Listowel, Co. Kerry.</p>
                        <p>It is clear from his discussion that music fills a central place in his life. He reflects on his short stint as a professional musician that interrupted his undergraduate education at Fordham University and how the reality of making a living sent him back to City University of New York-Lehman College for a degree in accounting. Despite a 20+ year career on Wall Street he has never abandoned his music and Mahon recalls how he pursued his passion for traditional music while stationed around the world for work, including years in Japan and England. His discussion of the traditional music world and its active participants is among the most fascinating highlights of the interview, in particular, his memories of performing with Eileen Ivers in Japan are wonderful.</p>
                        <p>Mahon also discusses the various career paths of his siblings, particularly his two brothers, who pursued seemingly “typical” Irish vocations in law enforcement. He observes that the attacks on the World Trade Center altered the parameters of their work and made their occupations anything but typical. He speaks candidly about life on Wall Street and the ethnic culture of certain corporations and jobs in the financial services sector, but admitted that he did not suffer one way or the other by being Irish. As an ex-pat for most of his adult life and career, his identity as a “Yank” created more of an identity issue for him.</p>
                        <p>He and his wife have three children who are themselves musicians but who identify themselves as European rather than Irish, American or Irish American. He reflects on how he and his wife met and the Irish background of his wife and her experience as an Irish dancer. He muses on the Riverdance craze and the boost it gave the Irish dance industry around the world, including the dance studio that his sister-in-law operates in Florida. In one anecdote he recalls how out of context it was to see young Japanese girls in “Sheila” wigs at competitions in Japan.</p>
                        <p>This oral history with Pat Mahon was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview is 1 hour, 18 minutes, and 18 seconds long, on two CDs and has been logged at ten-minute intervals. The interview took place on November 14, 2007.</p>

Murphy briefly describes his experience as a student at Our Lady of Lourdes, a Catholic grammar school in Queens. He discusses his education at Regis High School, a full scholarship Jesuit institution in Manhattan.

                        <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
                        <p>Sister Regina Murphy discusses many aspects of her life, beginning with her parents’ immigration to America and her childhood in Riverdale, New York. She details the occupations her parents held as new arrivals in America – her mother a live-in maid and her father a clerk in a grocery store. When her parents wed her father quickly bought out a grocery store, and her mother stopped domestic work and assisted in the store.</p>
                        <p>Sister Regina Murphy reviews her childhood – she received religious education throughout her life, attending St. Margaret’s School in Riverdale for primary education, New York, Sacred Heart of Mary High School, and two years at Marymount College in Tarrytown before she entered the convent. She stresses that her religious education during those formative years greatly influence her decision to enter the convent.</p>
                        <p>Sister Regina Murphy discusses her decision to enter the convent, against the wishes of her parents. Four years earlier, her older brother Tommy joined the brothers. He would leave before taking final vows, but at the time she entered the convent in 1959, he was still with the brothers. She declares that the only time she remembers her father using profanity was when she told him she wanted to enter the convent. In a similarly vehement reaction, her mother tore up her acceptance letter to the Sisters of Charity, and it was only upon further inquiry with the order that Sister Regina Murphy learned she had been accepted. Although her parents did not initially accept her vocation, Sister Regina Murphy says she felt truly called to enter the convent. She recalls that she was especially stirred at the prospect of doing missionary work.</p>
                        <p>Sr. Murphy describes her first foreign mission was to the Bahamas. She worked in education, but during her tenure, she noticed the stark difference between the lives of the native poor and the tourists who visited the Bahamas. This started her personal quest for a better understanding of social justice principles. She talks about her appointment as Mission Coordinator for the order, and how she was able to visit missions in Guatemala. She recalls meeting with a fellow sister named Barbara Ann Ford, who was influential in creating water projects in the poor villages and who participated in The Recovery of Historical Memory project organized by Bishop Juan Geraldi to collect the stories of the survivors and victims of the civil war in Guatemala. Part of the project included providing mental health service for those who were affected by the rampant violence and crime that accompanied the war. Sr. Barbara was shot and killed in 2001 under suspicious circumstance, however her work in Guatemala helped many and also influenced Sister Regina Murphy.</p>
                        <p>She describes how her experiences in the Bahamas and Guatemala along with the coming of Vatican II sparked an awakening in her. She saw the changes enacted as part of Vatican II as an energizing and necessary force in the Church. It seemed to her that religious work evolved from seeking to help individuals on a day to day basis to fixing the societal infrastructure responsible for basic injustices. These realizations propelled Sister Regina Murphy to become involved in justice, peace, and corporate responsibility projects.</p>
                        <p>When advocating for corporate responsibility, Sister Regina Murphy describes her integral role in the implementation of the McBride Principles and the enactment of the Fair Employment Act in Northern Ireland in 1988. As part of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, she traveled to Northern Ireland in the hopes of getting factories to sign onto the McBride Principles. She recalls that the ICCR was successful in obtaining the signatures of fifty companies. While Sister Regina Murphy was in one General Motors Factory in Northern Ireland, she talks about how her presence caused a temporary strike and shutdown of the factory. Although she was not dressed in a traditional habit, workers guessed that she was a Catholic nun. Seeing her discuss workplace issues with managers in the factory upset the predominately Protestant workers, inciting them to walk off the job. Despite this fervor against the McBride Principles, it was her support, along with that of the ICCR, that she says helped to pass the Fair Employment Act.</p>
                        <p>Sister Murphy talks about the current state of vocations in the Church and what she sees for the future of the convent. She describes her life today as a religious woman – what it means to her and what her Irish identity means. She ends the interview talking about her job as property manager for the order, acting as general contractor on major construction projects for the order</p>
                        <p>This oral history with Sister Regina Murphy was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview took place on 9 November 2007 at Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Julia Ryan and Linda Dowling Almeida. The interview is 2 hours, 47 minutes long, on 2 CDs and had been logged at ten minute intervals.</p>

                        <p>Ms. O’Callaghan discusses a variety of topics beginning with her family and childhood in Cork, Ireland and what life was like growing up on a farm. After obtaining a Bachelor of Arts in English, French and Sociology at the University of County Cork, she moved to Dublin to pursue a Higher Diploma in Education at Trinity College. In Dublin she was given the chance to teach inner-city kids, a far cry from the one room school house she attended as a child. She describes returning to Cork to work for Cork Local Radio as a news presenter. Wanderlust led her to answer an ad in the newspaper for a job marketing Irish hand-crafts in San Francisco, California. Ms. O’Callaghan was handed an H-3 Visa to live in what describes as a fantasy life in the United States, an experience that was somewhat different from the lives of the people she helped later in life.</p>
                        <p>She talks about how she turned a temporary stay into a permanent move after she left California for New York to work as a flight attendant for Transamerica Airlines. Reintegrating the Irish back into her life, she became involved with Adrian Flannelly’s Irish radio talk show. She describes how the growing number of undocumented Irish in the mid-1980s led Adrian Flannelly to discuss solutions with the Archdiocese of New York. The talks led to the formation of Project Irish Outreach within the Catholic Charities division of the archdiocese, under the supervision of Monsignor James Murray.</p>
                        <p>Asked to help with the project’s establishment, Ms. O’Callaghan found a real purpose in helping the undocumented. She wrote a small booklet titled 
                            <emph render="italic">Immigrating USA: A Guide for Irish Immigrants</emph> to answer immigrants frequently-asked questions. Project Irish Outreach had a great impact on Ms. O’Callaghan and the Irish community and she discusses at length the work that the project was able to do through community outreach, immigration and social services, and partaking in efforts to inform people of their rights. The program became a social worker network in a number of fields.</p>
                        <p>She recalls the mobilization of the Irish American community along with various other social service and legal organizations during the 1980s, also noting the always positive attitude that Americans, especially New Yorkers, have had towards the Irish.</p>
                        <p>While discussing the way her position and role within Catholic Charities has diversified and evolved, Ms. O’Callaghan explains the transformation of Project Irish Outreach since its establishment in 1987. She expresses the many ways in which immigration and the immigrants themselves have changed over time, including the complexity of the immigration system and the choices available to immigrants and emigrants. She delves into the hurdles that the undocumented and documented have to face and the ways the immigration system and legislation can evolve to fit the needs of the immigrant population.</p>
                        <p>She closes with describing the strength of the Irish community and the people that have affected her life through her work and what her Catholic and Irish identities mean to her.</p>
                        <p>Patricia O’Callaghan was interviewed on 2 November 2007 at Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Katie Hiebert, Linda Dowling Almeida, and Joe Ready. This oral history was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview is 1 hour, 41 minutes long, on two CDs and had been logged at ten minute intervals.</p>

                        <p>In this interview, O'Driscoll provides detailed information on her childhood in Skibbereen, County Cork, Ireland, including living in rural Ireland and the effects World War II had on her family such as power outages and food rationing. She discusses the options available to her after secondary school at the time and her decision to immigrate to the United States in 1958 to further her education.</p>
                        <p>Upon arriving in New York City, O’Driscoll interviewed with the three companies in the city known for hiring large numbers of Irish: the phone company, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, and Citibank. Within one month of her arrival, O’Driscoll began working at Citibank, a job she kept until 1964. She discusses in detail the discrimination faced by immigrants at the time, including the perception vocalized by an interviewer that the Irish were uneducated. O’Driscoll continues to speak about her early accounting jobs and her eventual hiring at JP Morgan &amp; Co. in 1974.</p>
                        <p>In 1975, O’Driscoll enrolled at Brooklyn College and received her Bachelor of Science degree in accounting in 1981. She talks about her decision to return to school and the impact it had on her career. She discusses the discrimination she dealt with as a woman working on Wall Street at the time including being passed over for promotions and eventually having to change departments because of the lack of advancement opportunities open to her.</p>
                        <p>Active in the Irish community, O’Driscoll became involved in the Ladies Auxiliary of the Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH), the National Association for Irish Justice 1969, the Cork Association and in 1989 its first woman president. O’ Driscoll served an integral part in the formation of the Irish Immigration Reform Movement (IIRM) in 1987. She discusses in detail the grassroots efforts of the organization including interaction with legislators and the campaign to raise awareness locally and nationally on the issue and is frank in her assessment of the great obstacles facing the very small group. The IIRM was successful in their efforts in 1990 with the passing of HR-4300, the Immigration Act of 1990. O’Driscoll also speaks about her continued involvement with the Emerald Isle Immigration Center in Woodside, Queens.</p>
                        <p>O’Driscoll currently resides in Brooklyn, New York and is still a member of the Cork Association and a trustee and secretary of the Emerald Isle Immigration Center Executive Committee.</p>
                        <p>Mae O’Driscoll was interviewed at New York University’s Glucksman Ireland House on 18 November 2005 by Bethany Hartzell and Linda Dowling Almeida.

                        <p>Rooney discussed the significant role that family and tradition plays in his life. He also discussed his ties to Mayo and Newry, Co. Down, Ireland. His great grandfather, Dan Rooney, and great grandmother Margaret Devlan, emigrated from Ireland to Wales via Prince Edward Island for 10 years, and then came to Coulter, Pa (outside of Pittsburgh) in the United States.</p>
                        <p>When the Rooney’s arrived in America, Jim’s great grandfather, Dan Rooney, a distinct leader in the 1st Ward of Pittsburgh’s North Side, opened a bar on Federal Street. The bar encapsulates the Rooney’s future business style in that it led to his grandfather’s introduction into professional boxing and sports as well as leading him into the position of 1st Ward Chairman on the North Side, which evolved his career into politics.</p>
                        <p>His grandfather, Art “The Chief” Rooney, was married to Kathleen McNulty in June of 1931 and had 5 children. He grew up and lived all his life in the North Side of Pittsburgh. He was an adamant sports fan and loved to gamble. He played minor league baseball from 1920-1925, and made the Olympic Boxing Team in 1920, but did not participate. He also played in many minor league football teams around Pittsburgh. Jim referred several times to his grandfather as a risk taker.</p>
                        <p>His maternal grandparents came to America from Ballaghaderreen, County Mayo, Ireland. Martin Reagan came in 1921 and sent for his wife Mary Duffy in 1923.2 of 10 kids grew up in Pittsburgh’s North Side, which he refers to as the Irish Ghetto in the turn of the 19th century. Rooney grew up there, too. His mom went to University of Pittsburgh later in life to gain the education that she had always wanted. His mom viewed vernaculars as an anathema, and had a ‘tough as nails’ personality that he asserts to the large family that she was in care of. His maternal grandmother is still alive today at the age of 96. Jim notes that his mother and grandmother are very similar in their tough personalities. He talked about the role his mother, Patricia Reagan, and his grandmother, Mary Duffy, played in his childhood. They emphasized education and compassion, while maintaining a ‘tough as nails’ demeanor. However he talks about his dad being the biggest influence in his adult life. He says this is because his dads inability to engage with a child. He discussed that his mother and father had met in the first grade and grew up together.</p>
                        <p>Dan Rooney, Jim Rooney’s father, was born 7-30-1932 on the North Side of Pittsburgh, PA and is the current owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers football team, which was passed down to him from his father Art “The Chief” Rooney in 1975. He was a member of the 1950 class at North Catholic High School and the 1955 class at Duquesne University. He is the Vice-Chairman of the American Ireland Fund, involved in The United Way of America, The American Diabetes Association, Presbyterian University Hospital, The Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation and Duquesne University. He is also the benefactor of the Rooney Prize for Irish Literature, the founder of the Newry-Pittsburgh Partnership, and is the 3rd person to ever receive the Charter of Newry. He was also inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2000.</p>
                        <p>He talks of his St. Bernard’s and Gilmour Academy Catholic School upbringing in St. Peter’s parish on the North Side of Pittsburgh, PA. Jim tells how his own kids have continued on, with the tradition of Catholic Schooling. He discusses the unique blend that Catholic school brings to a child’s education. He also talks of his ties to St. Peters Church near the Steelers stadium on the North Side of Pittsburgh and how everyone in his family has been baptized and married there and that he still goes to church there.</p>
                        <p>After his completion of college, he went to South Africa and worked with diabetic youth, which he says opened his eyes up to working with Ireland. In the mid 90’s, right after he got out of college, he went to Belfast to support his father’s efforts with the Ireland Fund. He was inspired by the immense economic growth that he witnessed from the first visit to Ireland in 1976 to his current visits in the 90’s, which motivated him to remain involved with efforts in Ireland.</p>
                        <p>A year after completing Boston College, Jim traveled to South America to work with diabetic youth. After this, in the mid-90’s Jim’s father, Dan Rooney, asked him to take up business dealings in Belfast to support his father’s work with the American Ireland Fund.</p>
                        <p>In 2001, he ran for state Senate as Democrat and lost, but has worked for many political campaigns. His wife steered him away from politics due to the stress and exposure in politics.</p>
                        <p>He talks about his five attempts at starting his own business, in which two have failed, one has been slightly successful and his current engagement is in progress. Part of his current business involved him in the creation of security robots called the ‘Kuchera Robots’ for the 2006 Super Bowl in Detroit as the director of First Link. The Kuchera Robot is a 30-pound robot that spins, crawls and looks through windows by remote control and takes photos; created for the use in Iraq, but used in the 2006 Super Bowl. First Link is in charge of marketing ideas, and works with Pantherlab Works to advance the technology in the ideas.</p>
                        <p>Jim Rooney was interviewed at New York University’s Glucksman Ireland House on November 9th 2006 by Amanda Snatchko and Marion Casey. The interview took place before Jim was scheduled to talk about his father and the Steelers tradition later that night at the Glucksman Ireland House as well.</p>

                        <p>Ryan discusses the neighborhood in which he grew up. He describes 1920’s Pelham Bay in the Bronx as farmland with fruit trees and gardens. He remembers his childhood as well as his family, specifically his mother and father, immigrants from Ireland who met in New York City. He discusses his Catholic upbringing and describes his parents’ reaction to his desire to be a priest; his mother’s delight and his father’s support.</p>
                        <p>After attending P.S. 71 for three years, Ryan attended the parish elementary school of Our Lady of Assumption after it opened in 1928, graduating in 1933. He continued his education at Cathedral College for high school and his first two years of college and then St. Joseph’s Seminary for the remainder of his college education and seminary training. He reveals his father’s belief that he should always pay his own way and because of his conviction, he would not allow Ryan to attend Seminary school on credit as the rest of the seminarians did.</p>
                        <p>On January 27, 1945 Gerald Ryan was ordained by Cardinal Francis Spellman (1889–1967). Twelve years after entering the seminary in a class of ninety-nine, sixteen were ordained. He discusses the changes in the Catholic Church and the seminary since his pre-Vatican II educational training, including the drop in numbers of young men with vocations.</p>
                        <p>While waiting for a position as an English teacher at Cardinal Hayes High School, Ryan was assigned to St. Anthony of Padua parish in the Bronx immediately after ordination. He discusses his adjustments to parish life in an African-American community and how he came interested in the civil rights movement. Ryan marched in Washington, DC and heard the famous “I Have a Dream” speech given by Dr. Martin Luther King in 1963, and two years later joined King and other religious leaders in Selma, Alabama to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge in support of African-American voting rights. He describes the bus ride to Selma and the unknown fear of what could happen during the march. He tells the story of the angry southerners yelling at those participating in the protest and how the atmosphere changed once the crowd recognized singer Harry Belafonte in the line of marchers. Back in New York, Ryan continued to participate in demonstrations on issues affecting all poor communities such as housing and health.</p>
                        <p>Ryan served at St. Anthony’s until he was assigned as pastor of St. Luke’s parish in 1966. Several years later he learned that the call for a teaching position never came in 1945 because the pastor of St. Anthony’s had personally requested of the Cardinal that Ryan remain in the parish to work with him. Looking back, Ryan feels that remaining at St. Anthony’s instead of leaving to teach was for the best.</p>
                        <p>As pastor of St. Luke’s parish, Ryan ministers to a primarily Hispanic community. He discusses the differences in participation between his current parish and the primarily Irish parish he belonged to as a child. He tells of the current parishioners’ interest in participating in the liturgy and running of the parish. He speaks of the irony that as a young priest he served with three other priests in a parish and now as an older man he is the only priest in a bi-lingual parish. Ryan is currently the longest serving pastor in the diocese of New York. He spends his day running the parish with his other staff and administering to his parishioners’ needs. In addition to saying the majority of the masses at St. Luke’s, he works with the parish council and leads a weekly session for the troubled teens of the parish.</p>
                        <p>Ryan concludes the interview by discussing his opinions on the reasons for the lack of vocations to the priesthood and the loss of American Catholic faith. He speaks of his love for Ireland and in particular his special devotion to the Shrine of Our Lady of Knock in County Mayo.</p>
                        <p>Rev. Msgr. Gerald Ryan was interviewed at New York University’s Glucksman Ireland House on 17 November 2005 by Natalie Rose and Linda Dowling Almeida. This oral history with Msgr. Gerald Ryan was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview is 99 minutes long, on two CDs and had been logged at ten-minute intervals.</p>

                        <p>Eithne Golden Sax (b. 1919) is a retired multilingual translator for the United Nations, daughter of Irish nationalist organizer Peter Golden, and pupil of Irish republican author Ernie O’Malley.</p>

                    <scopecontent id="ref324">
                        <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
                        <p>Eithne begins by talking about the family backgrounds of her parents, Peter Golden and Helen Merriam, who met while performing in 
                            <emph render="italic">A Comedy of Errors</emph> with Ben Greet’s Elizabethan Society of England. She recounts incidents from the family’s time in the Amsterdam Avenue apartment, such as visits by Irish nationalists like the poet Joseph Campbell (1879-1944) and Eamon De Valera as well as members of the Friends of Freedom for India. Purnendu Sinha apparently was admired for his ability to “carry the nappies in from the line so elegantly.” Eithne has only one clear memory of her father, when he tried to cure her earache with castor oil.</p>
                        <p>Eithne discusses her mother, Helen Merriam, in great depth, describing her as a “bohemian, a maverick,” and the “black sheep of the family.” She repeats a favorite anecdote from Christmas 1918 that her mother obviously relished telling the Golden children. She describes the family’s move to Pasadena, California, where Helen sold books at Brentano’s until Ernie O’Malley convinced the family to relocate to Taos, New Mexico in 1931.</p>
                        <p>In Taos, Eithne met various artists and local Pueblo Indians, even dancing with Thornton Wilder (1897-1975) at the home of Mabel Dodge Luhan (1879-1962). Alexandra Belkovitch (d. 1983), wife of painter Nicolai Fechin (1881-1955), taught her Russian lullabies that would later inspire her lifelong passion for foreign languages. Every day O’Malley tutored the Golden children and a local Mexican girl named Aurora in subjects ranging from grammar to geography; Eithne claims he called the Goldens the “stupidest children in the world” despite her fond memories of these sessions.</p>
                        <p>As a result, Eithne moved to New Jersey to live with friends while pursuing an opera career in New York City in 1938. Her beloved Aunt Pat, her father’s sister, greeted her at Pennsylvania Station, she recalls. But she quickly set her musical ambitions aside. By 1940, she moved to Lisbon, Portugal to work as a Foreign Service clerk, translating for the legation during World War II, she explains.</p>
                        <p>Eithne then discusses her time exploring the local music scene in Lisbon, which was cut short when she returned home to Taos to her ailing mother who was sick with cancer. After her mother’s death in 1943, Eithne moved to New York City’s East Village. She describes her experience working for a local group of Basque sympathizers, and she discusses a past love interest, Antonio Irela, the Secretary of the President of the Autonomous Basque Republic, Antón de Irala Basque government delegate to the United States</p>
                        <p>Eithne also touches upon her musical pursuits, as she co-founded the New York Society of Classical Guitar in 1946, as well as the Guitar Review magazine.</p>
                        <p>In the next part of the interview, Eithne describes her experience working for the United Nations as a translator beginning in 1949. She met her future husband, Ernie Sax, at a United Nations party in 1956, and admits that she thought Sax was a snob after their first meeting and that he “looked down on us girls.” But a few weeks later, when Sax was hospitalized after a car accident, she visited him in the hospital, which Eithne claims was the start of a “great love affair.” Eithne and Ernie Sax married that same year.</p>
                        <p>In the small remainder of the interview, Eithne explores the idea of Irish identity, and she discusses her trip to Ireland in 1959. Eithne describes her life after her husband’s death in 1969, and details her current pursuits, explaining that she takes Irish language classes and attends events at the Glucksman Ireland House. Finally, Eithne explains that she is currently writing her memoirs.</p>
                        <p>Eithne Merriam Golden Sax was interviewed on 2 November 2006 at her home on in New York City’s upper east side by Elizabeth Bedell and Marion R. Casey. This oral history with Eithne Merriam Golden Sax was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. The interview is 140 minutes long, on two CDs and has been logged at ten-minute intervals.</p>

                        <p>Sexton provides detailed information primarily on his youth and family life, from 1942 to 1975. Sexton’s grandfather, James J. Sexton (1875-1947), was born in County Sligo (near the border with Donegal), Ireland, the son of the village blacksmith. He came to the United States at the age of 20 and settled in Brooklyn, New York, where he worked as a blacksmith and became an active member and eventual president of the International Union of Journeymen Horseshoers. James Sexton entered local politics in 1915 as Democratic District leader in the Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and by 1929 was serving Mayor James J. Walker as President of the New York City Board of Taxes and Assessments. Sexton gives an example of his grandfather’s character and influence during the Depression while head of Brooklyn’s Jefferson Democratic Club.</p>
                        <p>Sexton’s father, John E. Sexton, a graduate of Manhattan College and Fordham University Law School, died in 1960 when his son was eighteen, after years battling the effects of alcoholism. He discusses the good and bad experiences he had as a child, including hardships resulting from the chronic ill health of his father. Sexton describes how his father taught him the value of helping other people by bringing home what Sexton refers to as “handymen.” Rather than renting out the extra room in their house, Sexton’s father would take in homeless men who were frequently recovering alcoholics and allow them to stay until they got back on their feet. Sexton acknowledges the centrality of his relationship with his father to subsequent choices he made in life, and briefly talks about his strained relationship with his uncle Jim Sexton. He attributes his knowledge of his Irish heritage to his aunt Ruth Sexton (Sr. James Marie), a Dominican nun.</p>
                        <p>While remaining closest to his mother’s German family, Sexton personally identifies himself as Irish. He talks about the pastor-like persona of all the Sexton men in his family and how readily it translates to his current position as President of New York University and Dean of its Law School before that. Sexton attributes this love of people to being Irish and says this was passed down to him by his father. Although he refers throughout the interview to the NYU Law School as his “parish” and the university as his “archdiocese,” Sexton does not otherwise agree with the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. He discusses his personal concept of Catholicism and his relationship with the Church, reflecting on the Jewish identity of his wife, children and grandchildren.</p>
                        <p>He describes his education and work experience, especially his time at Fordham University and St. Francis College. Following his father’s death, Sexton began coaching a debate team at St. Brendan’s Diocesan High School for girls where his sister was enrolled. He talks extensively about the fifteen years he spent with the debate team, the significance of the experience both for him and for the girls he coached, and describes the first reunion the team had recently. He credits one of his teachers at Brooklyn Prep, Charlie Winans, with being the inspiration behind his efforts with the St. Brendan’s debaters. He recounts how his first application to Harvard Law School was rejected and how his friend, Lawrence Tribe, called in a few favors, convincing the admissions department to give his application reconsideration; nevertheless, Sexton’s commitment to St. Brendan’s was so great that he deferred going to law school until 1975.</p>
                        <p>Fifty-three minutes into this oral history, Edward C. Smith, general auditor and senior vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, arrives for a meeting and Sexton invites him to listen in on the remainder of the interview. He asks Smith if there is a demonstration outside, which is a reference to the rally organized by the United Auto Workers in support of striking NYU graduate assistants that was scheduled for noon that day outside Bobst Library. This is the second brief reference Sexton makes to the strike during this interview.</p>
                        <p>John E. Sexton was interviewed in his academic office in Vanderbilt Hall at New York University School of Law on 2 December 2005 by Shawna C. Meechan and Marion R. Casey. This oral history with John E. Sexton was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. Interview is 71 minutes, 56 seconds long, on two CDs and had been logged at ten minute intervals.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Shanley begins by discussing his childhood in the Bronx, and the difficulties he had in school because of his “differences.” He describes feeling misunderstood because of his creativity, particularly by his father, who, as a survivor of the Great Depression, wanted Shanley to pursue a career with security and a pension. Shanley’s difficulties in school manifested themselves as behavioral issues which resulted in hours of detention over the course of his academic career. He was asked to leave several schools before a teacher at his New Hampshire boarding school took him under his wing and ensured that he graduated.</p>
                        <p>Shanley describes his career at New York University and the way in which a five year leave from academia after high school helped his education. He explains how his two year stint in the Marine Corps in the middle of the Vietnam War provided him with the insight to negotiate institutional structures for his personal benefit, rather than battle against them. Shanley credits the discipline of the Marines for his success at NYU, from which he graduated as valedictorian of his class in 1977.</p>
                        <p>Much of Shanley’s best known work focuses on individuals struggling within institutional structures, particularly 
                            <emph render="italic">Doubt</emph>, which Shanley based on his experiences in religious-based institutions. He identifies the inspiration for 
                            <emph render="italic">Doubt</emph> as emerging from his own philosophy on life -- which advocates sticking to his convictions, regardless of his certainty in their correctness -- and draws on some of his school experiences, particularly his primary school, St. Anthony’s, which was run by the Sisters of Charity. His first grade teacher was the model for the character of Sister James in the play. Shanley later hired her as a consultant on the movie version of the play, which premiered in 2008.</p>
                        <p>
                            <emph render="italic">Doubt</emph> has garnered multiple awards for Shanley, including a 2005 Tony for best play and the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Shanley was also the recipient of an Oscar for best original screenplay for the movie 
                            <emph render="italic">Moonstruck</emph>, a 1987 film that focused on the convoluted love life of an Italian American played by Cher. During the interview he focuses largely on the evolution of his career. He discusses life experience as it relates to his success, as well as persistence -- at one point, he was living below the poverty line and working a series of odd jobs, but still producing about one play a year.</p>
                        <p>Shanley talks about his two adopted sons from his first marriage who come from very diverse ethnic backgrounds. Shanley does not consider ethnicity an integral part of their upbringing, and refers to his own Irishness as being a literal part of him, rather than something that derives from his own social or cultural upbringing. He does, however, credit his Irish background for his ability to tell a story, saying that a visit to his family’s farm in Ireland made him realize how like his Irish relatives he was—finally finding a niche after years of feeling “different” and “weird.”</p>
                        <p>John Patrick Shanley was interviewed on 5 November 2008 at Glucksman Ireland House at New York University by Mary Catherine Williamson and Linda Dowling Almeida. This oral history with John Patrick Shanley was digitally recorded on a Marantz CDR420. Interview is 1 hr, 22 minutes long, on 2 CDs and has been logged at 10 minute intervals.</p>

                        <p>Smyth opens the interview talking about her childhood, starting with her mother’s pregnancy with her and her twin sister. She discusses the experiences of growing up with ten siblings who all lived under one roof in an old farmhouse. She describes her mom cooking on a hearth fireplace and the sleeping arrangements in her house. She remembers her mother as a fantastic cook, making delicious dishes with simple resources and how her mother would make Treasa gather the wood in the morning to start the fire in the hearth. She recalls selling the vegetables they raised on the farm and milking cows and talks about wearing rubber boots, or wellies, when farming. She admits surprise when she sees people wearing them today as fashionable footwear. She remembers how her dog Scotty would help her with the daily chores and talks about watching TV shows like Eurovision, Flipper, and Skippy the Kangaroo.</p>
                        <p>She remembers her dad’s passing and seeing a banshee that night, and knowing it was a sign that her dad had died. After her father’s death all her siblings had to help maintain the farm. She recalls with sadness that some of her dad’s customers did not pay their bills after his death and how that disturbed her because of his fairness to them while he was alive.</p>
                        <p>She talks about the importance of religion in her family. Her parents did not tolerate distractions or disruptions during their daily prayers and every Saturday her family went to confession. She recalls her first confession and how she could not think up a sin, so a nun told her to make one up.</p>
                        <p>She talks about going to school at Saint Mary’s National School in Cobh and describes how the nuns were very mean to her and how in one incident a nun did not let her use the bathroom. She felt the nuns were biased against her and her siblings because they were poor and from the country and made them clean up after the rich city girls. She also recalls a funny story about having to choose between getting in trouble with her sister or a nun. She talks about being forced to learn Irish in school without much success, but that at 17 she decided to really take an interest in the language and got a scholarship to study it at summer school. She recalls her choice to continue her studies at the vocational school rather than continue with the nuns. At vocational school she started to fall in love with learning as she acquired very practical skills like accounting and wood work. She also talks about one teacher whom she admired who played camogie.</p>
                        <p>She recalls growing up playing sports and listening to games on the radio. She talks about her mom’s disapproval of girls playing sports and that she had to sneak out of the house to try out for the camogie team, only to break her ankle at the tryout. On her second attempt she made the national team but managed to hide it from her mother. She remembers that her mother finally accepted her athletic pursuits later on in her life. She also talks about the importance of the sport to her even in America and how she would help other players of the game immigrate to the US.</p>
                        <p>She describes going to Gurteen Agriculture College to study farm management and how she was one of the only women at the school. She remembers not being treated well by her male peers. During her apprenticeship she performed a job that required three men to complete when she left. Smyth chats about working in pig management and her job on a pig farm supervising 10 men. She remembers how she had to work carefully with all the men to make them feel comfortable as members of a team and ultimately winning their respect and allegiance.</p>
                        <p>She talks about her first experience giving birth in Ireland, how she was kept in the dark about what was going to happen and where the baby would come from. She talks about the privacy in her household and the reluctance to share intimate information. She compares it to Ireland today and how more open the culture is and that people talk a little too much about their lives now.</p>
                        <p>Treasa describes coming to America for the first time and observing the degree of its diversity with some surprise. She discusses her early jobs as a domestic and how it was hard for her to make ends meet as a single mother. She talks about becoming a nurse and how at first she resisted the idea because she thought nurses were arrogant, but finally decided to go to night school. It took her four years to complete her degree. She talks about finding her social network by playing camogie at Gaelic Park and the importance of immigrants helping each other when they arrive through sports and other outlets. She also talks about being an undocumented alien. Treasa talks about her mom dying and how her mother waited to pass until Treasa was back in Ireland. She recalls having a vision of her father, who was dead, holding her mother’s hand as her mom died. She talks about the funeral and explains how Tommy Smyth, her husband, supported her during that time. She talks about how she met Smyth, an ESPN soccer analyst, and their 12 year courtship. Treasa talks about her faith and how Mass for her is the beginning of a new week. She talks about raising her kids in the Catholic Church.</p>
                        <p>She says her children identify themselves as Americans even though every summer Treasa sent them to Ireland to stay with family and experience life on the farm with their Irish relatives. She ends the interview describing how she is an Irish person in her heart but she loves America.</p>
                        <p>This oral history with Treasa Goodwin Smyth was digitally recorded on Marantz CDR420. The interview is 2 hours and 23 minutes. The interview took place on November 6, 2009, and the interviewers were Alexia Townsend and Linda Dowling Almeida.</p>
