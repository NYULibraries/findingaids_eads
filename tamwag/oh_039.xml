            <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
            <p>Miriam Frank’s exploration into labor-gay alliances began in 1990 with the publishing of a handbook titled 
                <emph render="italic">Pride at Work: Organizing for Lesbian and Gay Rights in Unions</emph>, which she co-authored with her wife Desma Holcomb. This project entailed oral history interviews with New York City activists, which sparked Frank’s initiative to delve further into the subject.</p>
            <p>In 1994 Miriam was awarded New York University’s Stephen Charney Vladeck Junior Faculty Fellowship. That year she began conducting interviews in New York City and would travel to six other cities to pursue her research. Her findings eventually culminated in 2014 with the publication of her book 
                <emph render="italic">Out in the Union: A Labor History of Queer America</emph>.</p>
            <p>Frank received her B.A., M.A. and PhD from New York University where she is currently a Master Teacher of Humanities. She has also authored many other publications including 
                <emph render="italic">The Life and Times of Rosie the Riveter: the story of three million working women during World War II</emph> (1982).</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>The collection consists of 79 interviews conducted by Miriam Frank in 1994-2009. Possible alternate spellings of interviewee names and/or pseudonyms are noted in the Scope and Contents note of that interview. Summaries of content are also located in the Scope and Contents note for each tape. These summaries are based off the notes of Miriam Frank.</p>
            <p>The interviews are both biographical and topical covering such themes as family and class identity, the influence of the institutions of the political left and/or the church, love, and death. Specific labor topics Frank sought to document were institutional policies and new bargaining issues with regard to lesbians and gays; the history of gay participation in unions, both hidden and "out"; resistance to gays and lesbians in some sectors of the labor movement; labor education and AIDS education; and the influence of community organizing. Through these interviews, Frank sought to expose individual situations of struggle and to create a detailed history of gay and lesbian activism in labor unions. In the course of her research, Frank conducted over 100 interviews, 79 of which are located at the Tamiment Library. Most of these interviews are discussed thoroughly in Frank’s book 
                <emph render="italic">Out in the Union: A Labor History of Queer America</emph>.</p>
