            <p>Edith Segal (1906-1997) was an American dancer, teacher, and poet. She was born in New York’s Lower East Side in 1906 to working-class Jewish immigrants. Throughout her life Segal was a committed leftist, and her work was closely tied to her political activism. A supporter of the Soviet Union, Segal formed the dance company the Red Dancers in 1929 and choreographed performances in honor of V.I. Lenin. Her other works focused on topics related civil and workers’ rights as well as Jewish cultural themes. She created her most famous work 
                <emph render="italic">Black and White</emph> in 1930, which was the first interracial dance performance in the United States. Later in her life Segal worked as a dance teacher at Camp Kinderland and published several books of poetry. She died in New York City in 1997.</p>
