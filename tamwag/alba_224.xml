      <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
      <p>Moses (Moe) Fishman was born in New York City in 1915. He dropped out of high school and
        later worked in a laundry and driving a truck. He joined the Young Communist League and
        became involved in anti-fascist activity in the mid-1930s. In 1937 he volunteered to fight
        in Spain with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, taking part in the Brunete offensive, where he
        was severely wounded when a sniper's bullet shattered his thigh. He spent the next three
        years in and out of hospitals in Spain and the U.S. He had recovered sufficiently to serve
        in the Merchant Marine in World War II. After the War he returned to New York and became
        active in aiding Spanish refugees, and took over as Secretary-Treasurer (later Secretary) of
        the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade (VALB) in 1950, when the organization was
        labeled "subversive" by the Attorney General's office (after a strenuous legal battle, the
        label was removed in the 1970s). He remained a political activist and kept his post with
        VALB until his death in 2007.</p>

      <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
      <p>The collection consists mostly of material accumulated by Moe Fishman during his many years
        as Secretary of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. It includes incoming
        correspondence from Lincoln Brigade veterans and others, among them representatives of
        veterans' organizations in Spain and elsewhere in Europe. Also included are clippings,
        pamphlets, memorabilia and photographs (many of them related to gatherings of Spanish Civil
        War veterans), three letters written by Fishman to Howard Leder(?) during his service in
        Spain, and some family papers. Also in the collection is a small body of papers and
        photographs belonging to Lincoln Brigade veteran, Court Bevensee; these were entrusted to
        Fishman, apparently at the time of Bevensee's death.</p>
