    <head>Historical/Biographical Note</head>
<p><emph render="italic">Dissent</emph> is a quarterly magazine of political and social criticism. Founded in 1954 by Irving Howe, Emanuel Geltman, and Stanley Plastrik, <emph render="italic">Dissent</emph> has published articles critiquing the political ideologies of the left and right for over 60 years. Informed by democratic socialist ideology and intellectuals on the political left, <emph render="italic">Dissent</emph>'s founders positioned the magazine in contrast to the liberalism of the West and communism of the East. Although <emph render="italic">Dissent</emph> identifies itself with the democratic socialism of its founders, its editors and contributors represent a broad spectrum of political outlooks. Since its formation it has published articles by a number of prominent intellectuals including Hannah Arendt, Norman Mailer, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Ellen Willis, Richard Wright, George Packer, as well as many others.</p><p>Irving Howe served as <emph render="italic">Dissent</emph>'s first editor from 1954 until his death in 1993. Following Howe's death, Mitchell Cohen and Michael Walzer served as co-editors of the magazine until 2013. The current editor of <emph render="italic">Dissent</emph> magazine is historian Michael Kazin.  </p>  </bioghist>
