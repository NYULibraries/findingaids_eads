            <p>The International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 66 sent a gift of their records in 1980. Photographs from this donation were separated at that time and established as the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, Local 66 Photographs (PHOTOS 029). The accession number associated with these photographs is 1980.012.</p>

            <p>The International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers Local 66 was founded in 1934 as the Architectural Guild of America, a New York-centered national union for architects and architectural draftsmen. In 1937, the Guild affiliated with the International Federation of Technical Engineers', Architects' and Draftsmen's Union, AFL, as Guild Local 66. From the beginning, Local 66 clashed with its CIO counterpart, the Federation of Architects, Engineers, Chemists and Technicians (FAECT). Disputes over jurisdiction and methods, followed by a disastrous FAECT strike in the late 1940's led to the demise of the FAECT in the 1950's. The leadership of J. Lawrence Raimist for 27 years as President (from 1940 - 1962) and then of Ed Meskin (in the 1970's) helped Local 66 to continue organizing in spite of changing technology and work location.</p>

            <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
            <p>This small collection of twenty-two photographs (including nine color snapshots) shows the leadership of Local 66 at special functions, at training sessions and making presentations at meetings. In addition, a number of photographs were shot in Hawaii (in one, Diamond Head appears in the background), with members wearing Hawaiian print shirts and badges. Whether these document a Local 66 meeting or convention that was held in Hawaii, or perhaps a meeting of an Hawaiian local of the American Federation of Architectural Engineers, is not clear.</p>
