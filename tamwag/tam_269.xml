            <p>Judith "Judy" Clark was a political activist in the 1960s and 1970s, and has spent 32 years in prison for her role as a getaway driver in a 1981 Brinks robbery that left three people dead. Clark represented herself in court, refused to participate in the proceedings, and absented herself from the court room for the majority of the proceedings. She is currently serving a 75 year sentence at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in New York.</p>
            <p>Judy Clark was born in 1949 to parents who were members of the Communist Party USA until the 1950s. She was politically involved from a young age, joining the Congress of Racial Equality in highschool, and Students for a Democratic Society at the University of Chicago. She was expelled and served a nine month jail sentence after participating in Chicago's 1969 Days of Rage. Clark later became a member of the May 19th Communist Organization (M19CO), an alliance between the Weather Underground and the Black Liberation Army.</p>
            <p>Clark underwent a profound transformation in prison, ultimately renouncing her status as a political prisoner. During the 1980s, Clark undertook psycoanalysis with Gilda Zwerman as part of a study on violent protest. Clark also has engaged in education and counseling around the AIDS epidemic, and has adovcated for college programs at Bedford Hills.</p>
