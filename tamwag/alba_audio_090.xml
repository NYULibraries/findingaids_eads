      <p>Albert Prago (1911-1993) was a scholar of Latin American history and Marxist economics, a
        college teacher and a veteran of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. After being wounded in Spain,
        he returned to the United States in 1938, and pursued a career in teaching and research. He
        published several books and articles on labor history, Latin-American history and the
        Spanish Civil War, earned a Ph.D. in history in 1976, and co-edited the 1987 anthology <emph
          render="italic"><emph render="bolditalic">Our Fight </emph></emph>with fellow Lincoln
        Brigade veteran Alvah Bessie.</p>
      <p>Albert Prago was born in New York City in 1911. His parents were Latvian Jewish immigrants
        to the United States. Although his upbringing was not religious, he explained in an
        interview that his desire to volunteer to fight fascism had its roots in his Jewish cultural
        identity, an identity that is reflected in his later research on Jewish involvement in the
        Spanish Civil War. He joined the Communist Party in 1934. Before his departure for Spain in
        1937, he was a charter member of Local 453, American Federation of Teachers, and taught
        social sciences in the Works Projects Administration adult education project. While a member
        of the Lincoln Brigade, he served both as Anglo-American editor of the International
        Brigades' daily newsletter and as the battalion's interpreter. Prago was wounded during the
        second battle of Belchite in March 1938, and spent more than a year in the hospital before
        his recovery was complete.</p>
      <p>After his return to New York in 1938, Prago concentrated his efforts on teaching and
        research, and remained deeply involved in radical political activity. He earned a Ph.D. in
        history at the age of 65 from Union Institute and University, and taught at the Jefferson
        School of Social Science, Hofstra University, Cornell University's N.Y. State School of
        Industrial and Labor Relations, Empire State College, and the New School for Social
        Research. His articles on the Spanish Civil War are collected in the 1987 anthology <emph
          render="italic">Our Fight: Writings by Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, Spain
          1936-1939</emph>, co-edited by Prago and Alvah Bessie.</p>
      <p>Prago retired to West Palm Beach, Florida. He continued to publish historical articles and
        remained actively involved with the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade until his death
        from cancer in July 1993.</p>
