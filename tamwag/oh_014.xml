    <head>Historical Note</head>
<p>The New York City Immigrant Labor History Project was led by Herbert Gutman, a professor of history at the City College of New York (CCNY), between 1972 and 1976.  The project sought to reexamine immigrants’ and migrants’ patterns of cultural adaptation to urban and industrial life in the early 20th century in order to challenge the prevailing theories in social history at the time.  Gutman designed the project to combine traditional historical research methods with the relatively new approach of oral history.  By documenting the lives of immigrants and migrants who settled in New York, New York between 1900 and 1930 and compiling data on their family relationships, work patterns, and associational lives, Gutman hoped to reveal the ways in which people from rural, non-industrial areas adapted to the structured environment of the factory and the crowded city.  </p><p>Between 1973 and 1975 almost 230 oral history interviews were conducted with Eastern Europeans, Irish, Italian, Russian, Scandinavian, and West Indian immigrants; black and Puerto Rican migrants; and the children of immigrants and migrants.  The interviews were conducted by faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates in CCNY’s Department of History.  Gutman oversaw the entire project and taught courses designed to prepare the student interviewers for conducting the oral histories.  Virginia Yans-McLaughlin, then assistant professor of history at CCNY, co-managed the project with Gutman and directed undergraduate student interviewers.  Three junior faculty members, Leon Fink, William Eric Perkins, and Ari Joel Perlmann, conducted interviews and taught courses related to the project.  Ronald Grele, an oral historian, served as a consultant and provided direction on the oral history interviews and conducted training sessions for the interviewers.   </p><p>The project staff worked closely with labor unions, cultural organizations, and nursing homes in New York City, including the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union; the International Longshoremen’s Association Local 1814; the Kingsbridge Heights Nursing Home; Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union; the National Council of Jewish Women; and the Workmen’s Circle Home for the Aged.  These organizations facilitated meetings between project staff and interested members or residents and allowed the project staff to arrange and conduct interviews.</p>  </bioghist>

    <head>Scope and Content Note</head>
<p>The New York City Immigrant Labor History Project Oral History Collection consists of 222 interviews with Eastern European, Irish, Italian, Russian, Scandinavian, and West Indian immigrants and black and Puerto Rican migrants, most of whom settled in New York, New York between 1900 and 1930.  Topics include education, childhood, and early life in the narrators’ countries and states of origin; arrival at Ellis Island and first impressions of New York City; assimilation; women's roles in the workforce and in the household; courtship, marriage, and  family life; processes of acquiring and retaining work; job responsibilities, wages, and working conditions; ethnic and racial makeup of different workforces, factories, and shops; labor unions and organizing in different industries; ethnic and inter-racial relations in the community and the workplace; living conditions in New York City neighborhoods; politics; leisure activities; and religion.  </p><p>The interviews capture the narrators’ pre-industrial experiences as a way of exploring their adaptation to life in an urban, industrial environment by covering all aspects of their life experiences.  They record the narrators’ memories from their childhoods through to the time of the interviews.  The majority of the narrators were in their 70s, 80s, and 90s, with at least two narrators being over 100 years old.  The interviews contain recollections of the narrators’ countries and states of origin; their reasons for emigrating or migrating; their working and family lives in New York City and elsewhere in the United States (US); their union and political activity; and religious, ethnic, or social organizations to which they may have belonged. </p><p>The narrators include first and second generation immigrants and migrants; men and women; Jews and Christians; and anarchists, Communists, Democrats, Socialists, and Republicans.  Occupations represented in this collection include garment workers, fur workers, longshoremen, musicians, household employees, cooks, carpenters, dancers, union organizers, electricians, elevator operators, and taxi drivers.  Labor unions represented in this collection include the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America; Brotherhood of Painters, Decorators, and Paperhangers of America; Hotel Employees &amp; Restaurant Employees International Union; International Fur and Leather Workers Union; International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union; International Longshoremen’s Association; International Union of Operating Engineers; Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union; New York City Taxi Drivers Union Local 3036; United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America; United Furniture Workers of America; and United Hatters of North America.  Cultural, ethnic, and social organizations discussed include the Carroll Park Senior Citizens Center; Congress of Italian Americans Organization; Council Workshop for Senior Citizens sponsored by the National Council of Jewish Women; Stanley M. Isaacs Neighborhood Center; and the Workmen’s Circle.</p><p>The interviews include women who never worked outside the home, both married and unmarried; women who left the workforce permanently after marriage and childbirth; women who returned to the workforce after the birth of each of their children; and others who returned only after all of their children had entered primary school or entered the workforce themselves.  Some narrators settled first in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Ohio, and Illinois before moving to New York.  Others immigrated to other European countries or Cuba before immigrating to the US.  Some returned a number of times to their countries of origin before settling permanently in the US.  There are interviews with people who became heavily involved in the labor movement while others did not concern themselves with union activity.  </p><p>The collection includes 11 compilations of excerpts from interviews, based on a specific topic, such as ethnicity, politics, and neighborhoods.  There are also recordings of roundtable discussions with potential narrators at the Council Workshop for Senior Citizens on 125th Street in Manhattan, New York and the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union Local 22.</p><p>Transcripts, indices, interview fact sheets, subject cards, and summaries are available for many of the interviews and are noted in the container summary when available.  An electronic version of all transcripts, indices, interview fact sheets, subject cards, and summaries are available by request.  Many of the transcripts do not contain the full interview.  The indices contain subject terms or phrases with the corresponding time on the recording at which they are discussed.  Some of the summaries contain a brief description of what is discussed at a certain time in the recording; others contain synopses of interview highlights without the corresponding time notes.  The interview fact sheets contain information relevant to the interests of Gutman and the project staff and were filled out by the narrators; a small amount of these were received with the donation.  The subject cards contain the same sort of information as the indices and summaries, but are typed on index cards and separated into subjects such as family, work, and education before and after immigration.</p>  </scopecontent>

This interview covers Sedrkk Accent’s life in Saint Kitts; his work as a boxer and later, a coal trimmer and fireman aboard ships; and his eventual immigration to the United States in 1963.  Accent begins by recounting his career as a boxer and how he enjoyed it.  He notes that while his first wife was very supportive of his career, often sitting in the front row during many of his matches, his second wife held little love for the sport and his involvement with it.  He describes the infidelity of his first wife; the tempestuous nature of their relationship; his discovery of her affair with a local police officer; and the violent dissolution of their marriage.  Accent describes his career as both a trimmer and a fireman aboard ships that sailed to a variety of locations including England, Italy, Greece, Canada, the Netherlands, Argentina, and Santo Domingo.  He recounts switching from trimmer to fireman because the latter was a less labor intensive job.  Despite admitting that he was not the most diligent Seventh-Day Adventist, he spends a good portion of the interview explaining the philosophy of his religion including his view of God as merciful and wonderful; the concept of doing the right thing to each and every human being; the need to lend a helping hand wherever it was needed; and the importance of upholding the Sabbath.</p><p>See also: Council Workshop for Senior Citizens I.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><geogname source="lcsh">Saint Kitts and Nevis.</geogname><subject source="lcsh">Seventh-Day Adventist men |x Religious life.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref850" level="file"><did><unittitle>Altman, Yetta: Audio Recording</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_463c028d044ab5402207f26a95dc1b50" label="Access cassette" type="Cassette">3A &amp; 3B</container><container id="aspace_76ec088ae8592c480a40714917db6556" label="Master reel" type="Box">86</container><container parent="aspace_76ec088ae8592c480a40714917db6556" type="Reel">850a - 850b</container><container id="aspace_d2324bfa3a39a180a533729ed08b4ccc" label="Master reel" type="Box">87</container><container parent="aspace_d2324bfa3a39a180a533729ed08b4ccc" type="Reel">850c</container></did><bioghist id="aspace_9901ae058aed6f4d9e1ce04f576c571d"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Yetta Altman was born in Poland around 1905.

She was one of five children.  After immigrating, the family initially stayed with Artler’s uncle before moving to Brooklyn, New York, where her father opened a butcher shop.  Artler attended school until she was fourteen, moving into the labor force as soon as she was able.  She worked predominantly in the garment district, making both children’s and ladies’ dresses, until shortly after her marriage.  Work was seasonally based, so Artler spent part of the year unemployed, varying from a month to half of the year.  While working in the factories, she became a member of an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union) and participated in both social and union activities.</p></bioghist><scopecontent id="aspace_3fdf0bdc8eddf9420c48b13eccad20b8"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>This interview was conducted on March 7, 1975 by Louise Mayo at an unknown location.  This interview covers Bea (Gitlin) Artler’s childhood in Poland; her immigration to the United States as a young child; and her life and work in the garment industry in New York, New York.  Artler briefly discusses her childhood in Poland, noting her father’s occupation as a butcher, before moving on to describe her memories of her initial years in New York City living in the back of her father’s butcher shop.  As business declined in their initial location, Artler recalls the way in which her family moved throughout the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan, New York.  Artler specifically notes that they moved to better themselves, whether through better rent or living arrangements.  She briefly describes her three years of school, placing more emphasis on the various jobs she held in garment factories making feather hat ornaments, children’s dresses, and the fronts of ladies’ dresses.  She describes the conditions of the factories in which she worked as being acceptable, neither exceptionally dirty or crowded.  She mentions the worker demographic as being split between Italians and Jews and that the two groups got along well within the workspace.  She notes the delineation of work between men, women, and children and the tension between the manager and the employees due to his extravagant lifestyle.  Artler notes that while she originally gave all of her wages to her parents in an effort to augment the household’s income, she eventually contested this agreement and kept more of the money she earned.  She discusses her membership in an unspecified union (likely the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union) and her participation in strikes for higher wages, shorter work weeks, and greater job security, all of which the union eventually succeeded in acquiring.  She recounts participating in union sponsored social events in order to stay informed about her community and going to movies and shows with the circle of friends that she made through the union.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref983" level="file"><did><unittitle>Artler, Bea (Gitlin): Summary</unittitle><unitdate normal="1975/1975" type="inclusive">1975 March 7</unitdate><container id="aspace_f714562e9ab6d897feeebe72639a20d9" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_f714562e9ab6d897feeebe72639a20d9" type="Folder">28</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref785" level="file"><did><unittitle>Auerbach, Fanny: Audio Recording</unittitle><unitdate normal="1973/1973" type="inclusive">1973 April 18</unitdate><container id="aspace_4fefa5c031e1a749d672f3bbb683fd63" label="Access cassette" type="Cassette">4A, 4B, &amp; 5</container><container id="aspace_c361b8f6c0bee6c572e3fa748cfc6334" label="Master reel" type="Box">76</container><container parent="aspace_c361b8f6c0bee6c572e3fa748cfc6334" type="Reel">785a - 785c</container></did><bioghist id="aspace_36b7a093ee9a6c0ccb0c21e212da50ac"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Fannie Auerbach was born in Romania in 1899.

This interview covers Morris Bagno’s childhood in Poland; his immigration to various European countries before, during, and after World War I; his immigration to Canada and the United States (US); and his life and work in the garment industry in New York and California.  Bagno begins by describing his childhood in Poland, noting that the industry in his town was much smaller than in the cities that he would encounter in the US.  He explains that he received the equivalent of a college education at his local yeshiva while working with his father in the timber industry.  He describes his decision to leave Poland in 1912 in order to avoid conscription into the army and to escape his father’s orthodox Judaism.  He recalls his immigration to various countries in which he lived including England, Belgium, Denmark, and Canada before his immigration to the US in 1920.  He recounts the awe he felt at seeing skyscrapers upon his arrival in New York City, which formed a stark contrast to the rural town where he grew up.  He recounts working with his uncle for a short time before deciding to find a job on his own and his his uncle’s belief that he was indebted to and dependent upon him.  He recalls joining the local chapter of the International Ladies’ Garment Workers' Union, which he remarked was special for its inclusion of women as members and the fact that women could hold high positions within the union leadership.  He discusses his progression from a tailor to union delegate to supervisor and liaison between workers and employers.  He mentions that he made sure to keep his home life and his work life separate as he did not want his wife becoming involved in union affairs or interfering in his affairs.  He notes that the passage of the Norris-La Guardia Act in 1932 and the National Labor Relations Act in 1935 mitigated the effects of the Great Depression by preventing lockouts and allowing for unionization.  He recalls temporarily relocating to Los Angeles, California in 1949 at the behest of the president of the union in order to deal with the rising tension in one of the locals between the Social Democrats faction, of which he was a member, and the Communist faction, who were viewed as dangerous to the union.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref14" level="file"><did><unittitle>Belson, Abraham</unittitle><unitdate normal="1975/1975" type="inclusive">1975 February 26 and March 12 </unitdate><container id="aspace_8a8c7eff55da7212a78bdb99753dd03c" label="Access cd" type="Cd">ref14, ref14A, ref14B, ref14C, ref14D</container><container id="aspace_af07e2d14daca9e34502100f859751d7" label="Master reel" type="Box">4</container><container parent="aspace_af07e2d14daca9e34502100f859751d7" type="Reel">14a - 14b</container><container id="aspace_a6160a9140cae42f377e92423955b57e" label="Master reel" type="Box">5</container><container parent="aspace_a6160a9140cae42f377e92423955b57e" type="Reel">14c - 14f</container></did><bioghist id="aspace_8d1c7d6b3d952b948678c83089c79328"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Abraham Belson was born in a small town near Minsk, Russia.

The location is unknown.  This interview covers Abraham Belson’s childhood in Russia; his immigration to the United States (US); and his life and work in the garment industry in Massachusetts and New York.  Belson begins by describing part of his father’s history, recounting a time when the Russian government forced the Jewish population to convert to a religion other than Judaism and his father’s refusal and subsequent draft into the army for fifteen years.  Belson recounts his membership in an unspecified Jewish club (likely the General Jewish Labour Bund of Lithuania, Poland and Russia) aligned against the czar and the feeling that he had to work against an authority that was not concerned with his well-being.  He describes immigrating to the US; living briefly in Massachusetts; and moving to New York City where his family and many friends from his hometown lived.  He spends the rest of the interview focused on the happenings of the International Ladies’ Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), which he joined in 1907.  He mentions an unsuccessful strike in 1907 that lasted 13 weeks, resulting in landlords evicting families from their homes when they were unable to pay rent and the fact that they had to beg in the streets until the union was forced to compromise.  He explains that the union reorganized between 1907 and 1910 and rallied for its first large general strike in 1910.  Belson describes the camaraderie that he felt with his fellow union members; the union events they attended together; and the picnics and other outings they had during their free time.  He notes that this was common in several tight-knit communities in Brooklyn, Bronxville, and other parts of New York that were populated predominantly by ILGWU members.  He recalls becoming a union officer in 1949, emphasizing that this position required that he earn the respect of both workers and management in order to be elected and reelected every year.  Belson describes how the conditions of the workplace for garment workers improved due to union influence, noting better wages, better job hours, more job security, and the fact that workers were no longer required to rent their own machines in order to work.  He shares an anecdote about a strike in Newark, New Jersey that resulted in a prolonged stalemate between management and the union and how he and other union members strongarmed the management to cooperate with the union liaison.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Antisemitism |z Russia |x History |y 20th century.</subject><corpname source="naf">International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union.

Clanton discusses her union involvement, including being introduced to the idea of unions by organizer Jesse Olson while working at Beth Israel Hospital, as a nurses’ aide, in Manhattan; going to various hotels in New York City for union meetings; discussing union activities with co-workers only on breaks or after work; and participating in a hospital workers’ strike in 1959.  Clanton discusses her opinion that despite the union not supporting striking workers sufficiently she realized the benefits of belonging to a union; her appreciation of Local 1199 after her retirement; and the educational programs and social activities that Local 1199 provided.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">African Americans |x Relations with Jews.</subject><geogname source="lcsh">Cleveland (Ohio) |x Economic conditions |y 20th century.</geogname><corpname source="naf">Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union (New York, N.Y.)</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref791" level="file"><did><unittitle>Cohen, Arthur: Audio Recording</unittitle><unitdate normal="1973/1973" type="inclusive">1973 April 27</unitdate><container id="aspace_74c89feeb810ccbbbc784e40c2259c29" label="Access cassette" type="Cassette">8</container><container id="aspace_3c9cebfa4864f414fa1c32c5a7363451" label="Master reel" type="Box">79</container><container parent="aspace_3c9cebfa4864f414fa1c32c5a7363451" type="Reel">791a</container><container id="aspace_10818c22a0eed74c034e422c5457ccd6" label="Master reel" type="Box">80</container><container parent="aspace_10818c22a0eed74c034e422c5457ccd6" type="Reel">791b</container></did><bioghist id="aspace_8bd44841a3f281c79f2ec7faaf86a6c1"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Arthur Cohen was born in New York, New York around 1886 and was the youngest of seven sons.

The location and interviewer are unknown.  An unidentified man interjects comments throughout John Duffy’s interview.  This interview covers Duffy’s childhood in Ireland; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1929; and his life and work in the retail and transportation industries in New York, New York.  Duffy begins by describing his hometown of Dundalk, Ireland, emphasizing the town’s position as a thriving railroad junction and its various industries including shoe and tobacco manufacturing (specifically P.J. Carroll &amp; Company Limited).  He recalls the railroad being the major source of commerce and both his father and his grandfather working on the railroad.  He describes patterns of Irish immigration to the US, noting that many of the immigrants came from the western and southern towns in Ireland; that the Irish did not often immigrate as a family unit; the effects of religious and political conflicts on immigration; and the often contentious relationship between the Irish people and the English authorities.</p><p>Duffy describes immigrating to the US in June 1929 via the SS Leviathan, noting that he was able to bypass Ellis Island, New York due to his immigration paperwork being processed by the consulate in Dublin.  He explains that he immigrated because he had a desire to travel and he recounts living with an uncle before moving to a boarding house on East 49th Street and 3rd Avenue in Manhattan.  He focuses on his work in the supply department at Bloomingdale’s in Manhattan, emphasizing the mistreatment of workers in other departments in the store; the lack of job security; and the lack of stable promotion tracks for workers.  He explains that all of these factors contributed to the union organization of retail workers in the store, specifically through Local 65 of an unspecified retail workers’ union (likely the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union).  He emphasizes the fragility of the early years of the union, describing tension among members when Bloomingdale’s gave the workers a raise and had the union disperse the raises from a lump sum.  </p><p>Duffy recalls leaving Bloomingdale’s in 1943 and becoming a transportation worker and joining the Transport Workers Union of America.  He emphasizes the union’s slow organizational growth over the course of the 1940s and 1950s; the conflict between Communist and non-Communist factions in the union; and the way in which the union’s president, Michael Quill, dealt with the Communists’ attempts to gain power.  Other topics include religious, ethnic, and racial divisions in the workforce, particularly in the retail industry, and the negative relationship between Duffy’s parish church and the Communist Party of the United States of America.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Transport workers |x Labor unions |z New York (State) |z New York |x History.</subject><corpname source="naf">Bloomingdale's (Firm)</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref331" level="file"><did><unittitle>Edwards, James</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive"> 1974 March 27</unitdate><container id="aspace_feed65b5264dba9d9830f0a45a3e8318" label="Access cd" type="Cd">ref331</container><container id="aspace_c4676a0423bd45b869037acf58fc6371" label="Master reel" type="Box">74</container><container parent="aspace_c4676a0423bd45b869037acf58fc6371" type="Reel">331a - 331b</container></did><bioghist id="aspace_9eaf058510dadfc67059c1ac24d8dbaf"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>James Edwards was born in the early 1900s in North Carolina.

Topics of discussion include the availability and types of work for longshoremen; the hiring process and wages; and accidents on the waterfront.  Mario Cinisomo and Rosario Ferrentino discuss the different types of work done by longshoremen; the fact that each job had different levels of danger; that some jobs were dependent on the weather; and that all jobs were supervised differently by the foremen.  They recall that in the early 1920s, workers usually worked one or two days a week, increasing to three or four days a week before the Great Depression; that during the Great Depression employment opportunities were limited; that work was steady after the Great Depression; and, at the time of the interview, there was more stability in the field because of rules implemented by the ILA.  Cinisomo recalls standing on the corner of Columbia Street and President Street at five in the morning in an attempt to be hired each day, and going to each dock if he was not hired on the corner.  He explains that some workers were hired as a group rather than individually.  Ferrentino discusses occasionally working a full day but only getting paid for half and making 36 cents an hour.  Cinisomo and Ferrentino discuss workplace accidents, including winches falling out of gear and boxes falling on workers.  They discuss their belief that accidents were unavoidable in the industry and the fact that there was little or no injury compensation. </p><p>See also: Canossa, Bruno; Cinisomo, Mario.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Depressions |y 1929 |z New York (State) |z New York.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref873" level="file"><did><unittitle>Ferrentino, Rosario and Mario Cinisomo: Subject Cards</unittitle><unitdate normal="1974/1974" type="inclusive">1974 April 4</unitdate><container id="aspace_fae35d82669526ac43d5d227c6965ebc" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_fae35d82669526ac43d5d227c6965ebc" type="Folder">23</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref344" level="file"><did><unittitle>Fields, [Unknown]</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_d6c49c6b6442c37730b6aafab2548f47" label="Master cassette" type="Box">29</container></did><bioghist id="aspace_f5b314311b38bb982ab8dc2e31f3d4d4"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Mr. Fields was born in Rotterdam, Netherlands in the early 1900s and grew up in Vienna, Austria-Hungary.

Fox’s accent, his tendency to mumble, and the fluctuation of volume over the course of the interview make him hard to understand.  The interview covers Fox’s childhood in Russia; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1906; and his work in the garment industry in New York, New York.  Fox begins the interview by describing his childhood in Russia, focusing on anti-Semitism in his hometown, which included pogroms and abuse by the police.  He recounts not being paid during the three years of his tailoring apprenticeship and receiving meager pay for his long hours of work after his apprenticeship.  He recounts the Socialist Revolutionary Party meeting at his house and learning more about Socialism at the library until his library card was destroyed when it was learned that he was Jewish.  </p><p>Fox explains that he immigrated to the US in 1906 after several failed attempts to illegally cross the border into Austria in order to sail from a port in Poland.  He discusses living with his aunt’s family on the East Side of Manhattan, recalling his acclimation to the spring weather and the low cost of food in New York City.  He describes his first job in a garment shop in New York City and explains that, in the beginning, he had to bring his own machine to work.  He notes that although he joined the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union (ILGWU) Local 23 in order to fight for better wages, hours, and working conditions, change was slow due to factions within the union and corruption among the union leaders.  He recalls a strike that occurred in the early 1950s, through which workers acquired a twenty percent wage increase despite conflicts with strikebreakers brought in from Chicago, Illinois.  He discusses the ILGWU opening a school to train machine operators and the union becoming more inclusive, particularly in terms of the Italian population’s involvement.  He explains that different skill levels and job types had different wage standards in the union and discusses working conditions in the garment shops.  He recounts that he established a ready-made garment store on Pitkin Avenue in Brooklyn with his brother and step-father, noting that the people paid to guard the store broke in and stole all the merchandise.  </p><p>Other topics include a comparison of his impression of the US before and after his immigration; his tumultuous relationships with his father and step-father; his lack of knowledge regarding pregnancy and sex prior to his marriage; his leisure activities, including reading the newspaper, playing pinochle, and attending shows at the Jewish theater; and his views on the birth control movement, the rise of political power among the Cuban and black populations, and the migration of Jews to the suburbs.</p><p>See also:  Life Before Immigration or Migration; Interview Compilation for Radio Broadcast; and Passage.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Antisemitism |z Russia |x History |y 20th century.</subject><subject source="lcsh">Pogroms |z Russia |x History |y 20th century.</subject><corpname source="naf">International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union.

He discusses the impact that religion had on both his and his father’s lives; his father’s conversion to Christianity and job as a deacon; and the church’s role in disseminating and giving credence to the ideas that it was natural for black community members to feel inferior as minorities and that it was impossible to live Christian life in the northern United States (US).  He recalls that living outside of the southern US gave him a broader perspective concerning racial relations, prompting him to adopt the belief that all people are equal.</p><p>Gray discusses the change in his opinions of the white population after he started working at Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, New York; the fact that working with a large group of people brought him into contact with different groups of people with whom he had never worked before; and his work as a delegate for Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union.  He recounts not encountering much racial discrimination in the northern US but attributes this to the fact that he was poor and did not have occasion to go to places that were likely to be segregated.  He explains that he would generally stay in areas with a majority black population and not put himself in a position in which he was likely to face discrimination and prejudice, although he does recount two incidents of discrimination he faced in New York.  He discusses jobs he had as a building superintendent in Manhattan, including his responsibilities; the types of people for whom he worked; and issues he had at the buildings regarding an unspecified building workers union.  He explains his decision to leave his work as a superintendent because of an illness and his desire to have a job with regular hours, which he found at Montefiore Hospital.  </p><p>Gray recounts one job he had as a porter at a coffee dehydrating business in the 1940s in which there was no discrimination and his boss and the other employees made a concerted effort to treat everyone equally, regardless of race.  He discusses the fact that he was encouraged to gain experience by shadowing repairmen who came to fix things in the building and regrets his decision to leave this job.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Janitors |z New York (State) |z New York |v Interviews.</subject><subject source="lcsh">Race discrimination |z New York (State) |z New York.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref897" level="file"><did><unittitle>Gray, Ivory: Summary</unittitle><unitdate normal="1975/1975" type="inclusive">1975</unitdate><container id="aspace_2bb9bfe34f9e6cce00ce0bb34fd78500" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_2bb9bfe34f9e6cce00ce0bb34fd78500" type="Folder">37</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref77" level="file"><did><unittitle>Green, Rufus</unittitle><unitdate normal="1974/1974" type="inclusive">1974 May 4</unitdate><container id="aspace_ec6aa7499f87187ff2c2c1f73a2666db" label="Audio" type="Cassette">194 &amp; 194A</container><container id="aspace_39d42abeec912625e4ade80da31af45d" label="Master reel" type="Box">21</container><container parent="aspace_39d42abeec912625e4ade80da31af45d" type="Reel">77a - 77b</container></did><bioghist id="aspace_facfdea221edc052d7aea69cd8f29b87"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Rufus Green was born in Emmanuel College, Georgia in 1896.

She was one of five children.  Her father worked as a merchant in Kiev and died when she was seven years old.  After she was widowed, her mother ran a small restaurant to support her family.  Heltzer attended school in Kiev until she was 15 years old, when she became a live-in apprentice to a furrier in Kiev.  She immigrated to the United States in 1906 when she was 17 years old.  She initially lived with her sister on Houston Street in Manhattan, New York before moving in with a friend in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  She attended a practical nursing class at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan from 1907 to 1908 and married in September 1909.  She moved to Shelton, Connecticut during World War I; moved to Worcester, Massachusetts to accommodate her husband’s business venture; and moved back to New York City in 1921 when that venture failed.

The date and location of this interview are unknown.  This interview covers Fanny Heltzer’s childhood in Russia; her immigration to the United States (US) in 1906; and her work in the garment industry and as a private nurse in New York, New York.  Heltzer begins the interview by describing her childhood in Kiev, noting that conversations regarding politics were forbidden in school; that she acquired her Socialist viewpoints from family and friends; and that she attended secret Socialist meetings.  She recalls that her mother paid for her to be a live-in apprentice to a furrier in Kiev because her sister noted the high-paying opportunities in that industry in the US.  She describes her mother sending Heltzer’s oldest sister to the US in the hopes that she would eventually be able to send for the rest of the family.  She explains that her brother was sent to Siberia due to his revolutionary activity and that their mother sent him to the United States in order to prevent his being arrested again.  She notes that she immigrated soon after him in 1906, with their two remaining sisters following her.  </p><p>Heltzer explains that she initially lived with her sister on Houston Street in Manhattan but moved in with a friend because of her sister’s overbearing rules.  She explains that she acquired her first job in a ladies’ shirtwaist shop through the recommendation of a friend, noting her initial fear of the speed and noise of the electric sewing machines; that the conditions of the shop were filthy; and that she quit because of the poor conditions and the long work week.  She explains that her next jobs in Manhattan, in a dress shop and at the Nemo Corset Company, were better due to the cleaner conditions in the shops.  She notes that employees at the Nemo Corset Company were afraid to organize and join a union because of the potentially hostile reaction from management.  She emphasizes the development of the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union during her time in various garment shops, noting the union's cocern over working conditions and lack of job security.  </p><p>Heltzer recalls joining a dramatic club where she met her husband, emphasizing her and her husband’s involvement with plays and the club’s choral group.  She recalls that her husband worked as a watchmaker but also had other business ventures.  Heltzer describes moving to Shelton, Connecticut during World War I and later to Worcester, Massachusetts as her husband changed jobs.  She explains that he invested in cotton goods and lost nearly all of this money in a failed business venture in Worcester, prompting the family to move back to New York City.  She describes working as a machine operator for the Works Progress Administration (WPA) through which she joined the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union (ILGWU) and the Workers’ Unemployed Union (WUU), established in New York City by the Socialist Party of America.

The interview covers Clara Howard’s early life in Hampton, Virginia; her family; and her opinions on racial discrimination and civil rights in the United States.  Howard discusses her education at the Gray School of the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute in her hometown, which she attended through the tenth grade.  She describes her family’s home and explains that although they lived on a farm, they were near large cities, including Newport News and Norfolk, and did not live in an isolated area.</p><p>Howard explains that her older sisters migrated to New York and New Jersey and that she decided to migrate to New York when she was 16 years old after visiting.  She recounts living on 139th Street in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan with her sisters in 1912; explains that African Americans were starting to move into Harlem at that time; and describes Harlem as beautiful, brightly lit, and clean.  She compares the living situation of minorities in downtown Manhattan to those in Harlem and her belief that the conditions downtown were more primitive than those in Hampton.  She compares her children’s education to her own and discusses her opinion that she received a much better education as her teachers were black, took great interest in their students, and served as role models.

She explains that she loves the United States (US) to the point where she would erase her Russian heritage if she could, recalling the often violent discrimination against Jews in Russia, and how this prompted her sister’s immigration to the US.  She describes her immigration to the United States in 1912 and her work with her sister to earn enough money to send for their mother in 1914.  She recalls that her aunt helped her get her first job as a seamstress on Manhattan Avenue in New York City, noting that she was instructed to hide in the bathroom whenever a customer entered the shop because she looked too young to be working.

He explains that General Electric would not hire him due to his Jewish heritage and so he sought work in the garment industry.  He recounts moving to Greenville, South Carolina at the behest of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America (ACWA) in order to augment the development of the garment industry and the ACWA’s presence in the southern US; sending his paychecks back to his family in New York; and visiting his family every two or three months.

This interview covers Isidore Opochinsky’s life in Hungary; his immigration to the United States (US) in 1921; his work as a fur machine operator in New York, New York; and his union activity.  Opochinsky tends to mumble and is sometimes hard to understand.  He provides few details about his childhood and early life in Europe, focusing on his involvement in the General Jewish Labour Bund of Lithuania, Poland, and Russia.  He recalls that he learned of the importance of unionization and the tenets of Socialism through members of the Bund.  He notes that members of the Bund who immigrated to the US had an easier time acclimating because they had the resources and social ties of an organized group.  He explains that he worked without pay for six months while he trained in the fur industry in Europe.  He recounts immigrating to the US in 1921, because he could not make a living in Europe after World War I, and settling with his brother in New York, New York.  He explains that he returned to Europe after a conflict with an unspecified fur workers' union (likely the International Fur and Leather Workers Union).  He discusses his return to the United States when he could not find work in Europe and his vow to rid the union of those in power who monopolized its funds and activities.  He recalls neglecting his education and his family in order to reorganize the leadership of the union, noting that after his removal of the corrupt leaders, the resulting chaos provided an opportunity for the Communists gain power.  He describes a strike that occurred in 1926, including the fact that it lasted 26 weeks; that the police killed many of the strikers; and that the strikers won, earning medical benefits and better hours and wages.  Other topics include details of the work of the fur industry; a comparison of labor unions and living and working conditions in Europe and the US; and his attendance and involvement in an unspecified conference concerned with Jewish labor issues in Geneva, Switzerland.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Jewish socialists |z New York (State) |z New York |v Interviews.</subject><subject source="lcsh">Labor unions |x Officials and employees |z United States.</subject><corpname source="naf">Allgemeyner Idisher arbayṭerbund in Liṭa, Poylen un Rusland</corpname><corpname rules="dacs" source="naf">Workmen's Circle (U.S.)</corpname><corpname source="naf">International Fur and Leather Workers Union of the United States and Canada</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref946" level="file"><did><unittitle>Opochinsky, Isidore: Summary</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">1975 April 19</unitdate><container id="aspace_6f766707caaa68a99d8a03824b53ac47" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_6f766707caaa68a99d8a03824b53ac47" type="Folder">65</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref156" level="file"><did><unittitle>Pane, Frank</unittitle><unitdate normal="1975/1975" type="inclusive">1975 April 30</unitdate><container id="aspace_fca896b3206d830d668ec840accc23e8" label="Audio" type="Cassette">170</container><container id="aspace_7f1255381cbbd74159c519c2879542fa" label="Master reel" type="Box">46</container><container parent="aspace_7f1255381cbbd74159c519c2879542fa" type="Reel">156a - 156b</container></did><bioghist id="aspace_df8aecb710eb06801a2015e181bd7ae8"><head>Historical/Biographical Note</head><p>Frank Pane was born on March 21, 1891 in Sorrento, Italy.

He notes that during the the depressions before and after World War I, Father Vogel at the Saint Charles Chapel on Van Brunt and President Streets in Brooklyn, New York would distribute food and coal tickets to poor families.  He describes evading the draft during World War II in order to support his family and shifting his occupation from bookbinder to work as a caulker in the shipyards.  He notes that he liked the work due to the outdoor environment, a stark contrast to the dirty factories that he had worked in as a bookbinder, but disliked the inconsistent employment.  Pane emphasizes the politics of New York City, specifically the relationship between Democratic and Republican policies during the Great Depression.  He ascribes the depressions of the early 20th century to the Republican administrations.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Bookbinders |z United States |v Interviews.</subject></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref157" level="file"><did><unittitle>Passage</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_b359d5bc4ad5c766d1fc3ff2c343ba2b" label="Audio" type="Cassette">242</container><container id="aspace_34222cd0f90673da37f9b4e498182c45" label="Master reel" type="Box">47</container><container parent="aspace_34222cd0f90673da37f9b4e498182c45" type="Reel">157a</container></did><scopecontent id="aspace_bc13ab3b4b0eb3f75ab28e32e00a2a63"><head>Scope and Content Note</head><p>This recording contains excerpts of interviews containing narrators’ experiences of the immigration process.

This interview covers Dominick Rocco’s childhood in Procida, Italy; his illegal immigration to the United States (US) in 1924; and his life and work as a longshoreman in Brooklyn, New York.  Rocco begins the interview by describing his childhood in Italy; his father’s cargo ship business; and the changes in Procida from when he left to the time of the interview, noting an increase in educational opportunities and a decrease in the number of people employed in labor-intensive jobs.  He discusses being encouraged to immigrate to the US after seeing the success of his father’s workers who would go to the US and return to Italy wealthier.  He explains that his immigration in July 1924 impeded him from acquiring his citizenship until 1948.  He recounts his settling on 2nd Street in Brooklyn with his cousin’s family and immediately working as a longshoreman.  He recalls joining the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) but notes that its early incarnations were weak and indistinct due to its lack of communication and organization, especially during the Great Depression.  He discusses the fact that longshoremen were predominantly Italian and notes that the large need for the occupation dwindled over time and will perhaps completely disappear in the future.  He describes living in a predominantly Italian neighborhood in which there were many large families of four to five children and that the older generations made sure to pass the traditions of their homeland to the next generation.  Other topics include his marriage and subsequent move to 49th Street and Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn in 1929; his first time taking the 7th Avenue subway in 1924; and his belief in building a better life for himself in the US.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref1138" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rocco, Dominick: Subject Cards</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_1a8c0cf46fa9d6319b765022623e9e8e" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_1a8c0cf46fa9d6319b765022623e9e8e" type="Folder">104</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref170" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rockwell, Alfonso: Audio Recording</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_eac84b19cd89689ca13e2c76efc7f062" label="Audio" type="Cassette">Missing</container></did><bioghist id="aspace_56a1d6d002992b519f3c90d94f589e16"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Alfonso Rockwell was born in North Cumberland County, Virginia in 1907.

She focuses on the contributions of those in the Jeanmen’s Guild of Saint Agnes Church and the volunteer work that went into making bed jackets for Saint Rose’s Free Home for Incurable Cancer at 71 Jackson Street in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan.  </p><p>All of the women describe their impressions of how the role of women has changed since they were young women, specifically noting the increasing number of women in the workforce.  One woman recalls working as a telephone operator until her marriage and wishes she had continued working after raising her children because she liked her job.  The women compare their children to the generation of children at the time of the interview, remarking that children have become more spoiled but also more intelligent.  Many of them note that they knew nothing about sex or pregnancy until they married because their parents felt that children should not be exposed to such knowledge.  In contrast, they observe how the generation of children at the time of the interview know more about these topics than they did at the same age.  </p><p>Stella Loregio speaks predominantly in Italian, with an unidentified man acting as a translator at the very end of her narrative.  She describes her immigration to the US; parts of her family history; her husband’s family and his death; a trip she made to Italy and her return to the US in 1950; and the life of her children at the time of the interview.  </p><p>Other topics discussed in the general interview include Italian mourning traditions, particularly those affiliated with widows, and many of the women’s trips to Italy, both in the past and at the time of the interview.</p><p>See also: Campanile, Lily.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref960" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rosanno, Adele; Stella Loregio; Rose [Unknown]; and Other Unidentified Italian Women: Summary</unittitle><unitdate normal="1975/1975" type="inclusive">1975 May 16</unitdate><container id="aspace_addfca1a9e5a71f0dc8b572da51dc205" label="Mixed Materials" type="Box">1</container><container parent="aspace_addfca1a9e5a71f0dc8b572da51dc205" type="Folder">73</container></did></c><c id="aspace_ref173" level="file"><did><unittitle>Rothman, Helen Taub: Audio Recording</unittitle><unitdate normal="1973/1973" type="inclusive">1973 May 9</unitdate><container id="aspace_b3ac82a023150e817c9876d88ee8cce8" label="Audio" type="Cassette">35</container><container id="aspace_9ae86c7eddecf5f230228b7efc55d7dd" label="Access cassette" type="Cassette">35</container><container id="aspace_901e1ffae09bd0b9499ee2a97ace4213" label="Master reel" type="Box">52</container><container parent="aspace_901e1ffae09bd0b9499ee2a97ace4213" type="Reel">173a</container></did><bioghist id="aspace_47698cbdcd0fd23b9418497a616538ee"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Helen Rothman was born in 1900 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but was raised in a small town in Hungary.

The narrator and location of this interview are unknown.  The narrator of this interview does not provide any information about himself.  This interview covers the reasons for black migration within the United States (US); the history of black sociopolitical movements; and the living and social conditions of black populations in northern cities in the US.  The narrator describes reasons black families would migrate from the southern US to the north, including a boll weevil infestation that severely damaged the cotton crop during the 1920s; the repression of minorities in the south; better education opportunities in the north; positive accounts from relatives; the economic opportunities created by the decreased immigration from Europe during World War I; and the idealistic mythology surrounding the north.  He recounts the ways in which racial segregation in the south gave rise to a black middle class that worked toward fulfilling the needs of the black community.  He elaborates on different sociopolitical movements that occurred between the Civil War and the time of the interview, noting that each of these developments assigned importance to different aspects of black life. He discusses Garveyism, the Tuskegee movement, the Niagara movement, and the development of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  Topics relating to these movements include the liberation of black people; the immigrationist movements; the development of the foundation of a strong black economy; and the legal struggles for social and political equality.  The narrator focuses on the logistics of the typical migration, including how a single family member, usually a young man, would establish the living and financial situation before the rest of the family moved.  He explains that black families typically settled in what he referred to as the black belts of the city, crowded areas with poor living conditions that were eventually alleviated by public housing projects.  Other topics include the exclusionary tendencies of labor unions, which led to black employees developing their own unions, especially for unskilled labor; the differences between the older and younger generations’ forms of leisure and entertainment, and the differences between white and black families with the extended family playing a much larger role in black families.</p><p>See also:  Interview Compilation for Radio Broadcast.</p></scopecontent></c><c id="aspace_ref355" level="file"><did><unittitle>Unidentified Italian-American woman</unittitle><unitdate normal="1973/1973" type="inclusive">1973</unitdate><container id="aspace_7e6cda37787ddd108ac48e66f91dbcdd" label="Master cassette" type="Box">29</container></did><bioghist id="aspace_86965dc9fde5c19aaf2eddb59827eac6"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>The narrator is not identified by name.

Antonio Uttaro and the interviewer occasionally speak in Italian.  This interview covers Uttaro’s childhood in Italy; his immigration to the United States (US); and his life in Boston, Massachusetts, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and New York, New York up to the time of the interview.  Uttaro describes his childhood and young adult life as being influenced by liberal politics, recounting listening to Italian anarchist Errico Malatesta speak in his hometown and how he developed a strong dislike for rules and organization.  He describes immigrating to the US as a way to become independent of his family, particularly of his father’s strict household rules.  He recalls his first moments in the US as frightening, describing how a stranger had to help him locate his cousin in Somerville, Massachusetts after he got off the train in Boston.  He recounts his life in Pittsburgh with his sister; his return to Boston; and his dual responsibilities as a presser working in a tailor shop during the day and as a student at night.  He describes his work as a presser as being seasonal and having to find various other jobs during the off-season.  He recounts marrying his wife in 1924; moving to New York by himself in 1927 to pursue better employment opportunities; and sending for his family a few months later.  He notes that he had no desire to become an American citizen until his son became upset about admitting at school that his father was not a citizen, and that doing so ostracized him from some of his Socialist friends.  He describes becoming a member of both the International Ladies’ Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) Local 89 and the Industrial Workers of the World, detailing the growth of the ILGWU despite tension between the Socialists and Communists within the union.  Throughout his interview, Uttaro emphasizes the practicality of compromise, noting that even though he was an active member of the union and a Socialist, he tended to criticize his affiliates when he believed they were pursuing their ideals to extremes.  He discusses taking part in a program through the union in which he visited older union members who lived alone after he retired at age 65.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><subject source="lcsh">Socialists |z New York (State) |z New York |v Interviews.</subject><corpname rules="dacs" source="naf">Industrial Workers of the World</corpname><corpname source="naf">International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union.

She recounts meeting and marrying a chauffeur from Virginia in 1922, noting that she separated from him when he lost his job during the Great Depression and had no inclination to find another one.  </p><p>Walters discusses her and her children’s move to New York, where she worked various jobs before marrying her second husband, who served in the Army, during World War II; traveling back and forth between the US and Germany with him between 1951 and 1956; and adopting another child in Germany.  She describes taking a course in nursing while she lived in Fort Benning from 1956 to 1962; working night shifts as a baby nurse at the Brooklyn Community Hospital for 11 years when the family moved back to New York; and augmenting the household income when her husband retired from the Army.  She recalls joining an unspecified union while at the hospital (likely Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union) but notes that her hospital did not go on strike because the administration acquiesced to their demands once they saw what was happening in other hospitals in the area.  She describes her duties as a baby nurse and emphasizes the friendly relationship among the staff members in the hospital.  Other topics include the lives and occupations of her children; her living conditions during the Great Depression; and racial discrimination in Georgia.</p></scopecontent><controlaccess><corpname source="naf">Local 1199 Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union (New York, N.Y.)</corpname></controlaccess></c><c id="aspace_ref993" level="file"><did><unittitle>Walters, [Unknown Man]</unittitle><unitdate type="inclusive">Undated</unitdate><container id="aspace_aa84fd71e5008b1e2265d9aa4d821145" label="Audio" type="Cassette">216A</container><container id="aspace_6e70a1b72ad19f5ef3024e710fb5acd8" label="Master reel" type="Box">99</container><container parent="aspace_6e70a1b72ad19f5ef3024e710fb5acd8" type="Reel">993a - 993b</container></did><bioghist id="aspace_612f116458644400b09821c786bb747c"><head>Biographical Note</head><p>Mr. Walters was born in Jamaica in 1895.

The first name of the narrator is unknown.  This interview covers Mr. Walters’ childhood in Jamaica; his immigration to the United States (US) when he was 19 years old; and his life and work in the construction industry in New York, New York.  Walters begins by describing the reason his family immigrated to the US, noting that his family moved primarily due to economic conditions.  He explains that many of his relatives had already immigrated to the US and some of his immediate family and distant relatives followed his family after their immigration.

He recalls working on the George Washington Bridge, Madison Square Garden, The Daily News Building, the subway in Queens, and schools near the City College of New York.  He joined an unspecified construction workers’ union in New York City, which he remembers specifically for its assistance in reducing working hours.  Walters lived in the Hell’s Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan and noticed that, while he felt safe in his neighborhood, there was a divide between the white and black populations.  He emphasizes the role of the sanitation workers in New York City, explaining that he believes that they are more important than the police because they keep the city clean.  He notes that while gangsters have consistently been a problem in New York City, narcotics have made the generation coming of age at the time of the interview more violent and destructive than their predecessors.

This interview covers Ellen Williams’ childhood in Darliston, Jamaica; her immigration to the United States (US); and her life and work as a baby nurse and a nurses' aide in New York, New York.  Williams begins by describing her childhood in Jamaica, specifically recalling her father’s occupation as a coachman in Kingston; the perception of this job as prestigious due to the wages and uniforms; and his occupation later as a pimento and coffee farmer in Darliston.  She recalls that despite the racial segregation in the schools and churches, children were generally friendly with one another.
