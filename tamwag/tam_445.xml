            <p>Charles Keller (1914-2006) was a painter and graphic artist who was a leading figure in the Workshop of Graphic Art. Based in New York City, the Workshop of Graphic Art produced many artworks and illustrations for leftist organizations in the 1940s and 1950s. Keller graduated from Cornell University in 1936 and studied at the Art Students League in the 1930s. He designed the exhibition "Airways to Peace" at the Museum of Modern Art during World War II and has been exhibited internationally with over 20 one-person shows. His career as a cartoonist began during his position as Art Editor of the

                <emph render="italic">People's Daily World</emph>. In addition, Keller was a founder of the art department of the Reference Center for Marxist Studies founded in 1980.</p>
