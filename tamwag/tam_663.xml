            <head>Audiovisual Access Policies and Procedures</head>
            <p>Researchers interested in using audiovisual materials in this collection (films, cassette tapes, VHS tapes, et cetera) must use a digitized copy, which we refer to as an access copy. Researchers may view an item’s original container, but the media themselves are not available for playback because of preservation concerns. Materials that already have already been digitized are noted in the collection’s finding aid and can be requested in our reading room; materials not yet digitized will need to have access copies made before they can be used. These requests are free of charge and can be made in anticipation of your visit. The process typically takes four to six weeks. To request an access copy, or if you are unsure if an item has been digitized, please contact tamiment.wagner@nyu.edu with the collection name, collection number, and a description of the item(s) requested. A librarian will respond to you with further information.</p>

            <head>Processing Information Note</head>
            <p>At the time of accessioning, materials were rehoused into new acid-free folders and boxes, with original folder titles transcribed. The original order of the collection as maintained by Pauline Park has been retained, with the exception of audiovisual and oversize items which were removed and rehoused in appropriate size boxes. Box-level descriptions were created by an archivist based on the contents of each box.</p>
